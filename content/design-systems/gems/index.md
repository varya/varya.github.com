## The Component Gallery

The Component Gallery is designed to serve as a reference for anyone building component-based user interfaces. The components in the gallery are not intended to be ready-made solutions, but rather inspiration for designers and developers to create their own solutions for the problems they are working to solve. The concept for this site comes from the 1977 book "A Pattern Language" which describes over 250 patterns for the physical world, but this site adapts this idea to the web, focusing on design patterns commonly referred to as "components".
