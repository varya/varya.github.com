The initial idea was to release some of my time while my fellow developer helps me with coding challenges that belong to myself, not to the client projects. I interviewed ten developers who positioned themselves as juniors or middle-level developers. My special pride in the process is that there were no annoying coding questions and time-consuming trial tasks. I only spoke with each candidate for about half an hour. During those talks, I introduced myself, described my business and the potential projects, learned about the people. We discussed possible collaboration and compensation. The most important factor for me was a personal match. I was not worried about a possible lack of knowledge and experience: the end goal was to teach and guide. I must say that all the candidates I had in that round would very well fit the role. I would even qualify many of them as far more than juniors. Because of that, I based my decision on how much I could help my future-to-be employee and partner. It was in the middle of a pandemic, and I figured out that my responsibility is to make a path to the IT market for the people whose previous industries suffered the most.

We had co-creation workshop sessions where we applied the design methods to figure out the work's scope. From the technical perspective, the knowledge boost included hands-on experience with GatsbyJS, styled-components, and Storybook.

Unfortunately, I cannot share the project name and description until we release it. But tech-wise, for Ira, it was deeper learning and practicing of Gatsby, including its advanced features. Similar to re-making my website, this project required writing a library of React components, but some of them were far more complex. Besides, some parts of the project were implemented with NextJs and utilized GitHubActions. During this work, Ira and Nikita e-met, and we managed to work together in a small team.

At the same time, the average rate is lower. This way, the client gets the expected quality of work but for a competitive price. In Ira’s case, I trained her myself, so we have a history of working together, I know how to lead her, I see what she can do entirely on her own and what she still needs guidance with.

Many say that as a consultant, you work for soulless companies rather than bring value to the people. But I believe that with the activity described above I discovered the opportunity to be useful. There are a lot of self-study people in IT (including myself) but I realise that not everyone has an opportunity to dedicate enough unpaid time for it. Men, people without kids and those who are financially supported by parents or partners win this race. My personal impact is that I can pay salaries for the less privileged while they are polishing their technical and product skills. Everyone wins: I have my projects done, my clients get helping hands whose work I approve and ensure the quality, a nearly senior developer comes to market.
