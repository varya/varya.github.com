They check\ntheir emails regularly and always reply very fast. Regarding any question about the current or upcoming courses,\nstudents can contact professors directly.\n\n<excerpt/>\n\nI cannot yet get used to the fact that in emails professors are to be addressed as \"Dear Piter\", or even \"Hello Peter\".\nUsing name and surname is already super polite. As for emails starting with \"Dear Respected Sir/Madam\", it is considered\nfunny! This we students were specially told during our onboarding in the first week.\n\nThe process is also very much adjustable and welcoming. This week, I realized that I cannot register to one of the\nneeded courses. It is possible to take this course next year, but I'm also working and very much stick to a certain\nschedule. The course turned out to be extremely popular, and all the places were already taken. But an email to\nprofessor solved the problem, and I was added there as an extra.\n\nAfter a little gap, in two weeks my studies start again. I hope to bring here more little updates :-)\n\n## Food\n\n<a href=\"https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169134/view/648737?page=0\" target=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/921322/14441195.52/0_9e621_2a51ab72_L.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"\nborder=\"0\"/></a>\n\nOn Mondays, I have my Swedish courses starting quite late and use this chance to get traditional Finnish cinnamon roll\nwith a cup of coffee. Gives me a lot of sugar to stimulate my brains :-)\n\n## Naked body culture\n\n<a href=\"https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169134/view/648733?page=0\" target=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/921322/14441195.52/0_9e61d_eaddf780_L.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\"\nborder=\"0\"/></a>\n\nIn the picture, you can see a typical shower room in Finnish swimming pool or gym. There is no doors or curtains. You\nare lucky if there are ledges in between of showers! And even if they are, they are usually very narrow and transparent.\nBasically, the strangers can see how you soap your butt. This might be explained by more human body acceptance in the\nFinnish culture but still sounds awkward to me :-/ Especially the fact that even expensive SPA centers do not provide\nadditional privacy in this sense. I guess, this is not considered needed and there is a doubt that people would pay\nextra for that.\n\n## Consumerism\n\n<a href=\"https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169134/view/648738?page=0\" target=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/892397/14441195.52/0_9e622_91ecbf5f_L.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\"\nborder=\"0\"/></a>\n\nIn Finland, at least in the capital area, there is a lot of hipster shops. Usually, they sell something simple for\nenormous prices. To my surprise, people manage to make a hipster shop out of regular stuff, especially if it costs much.\nFor example, I would never guess that you can make a shop for selling rubber boots, winter clothes, and plates at the\nsame time. But as you can see in the photo, it works fine.\n\n<a href=\"https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169134/view/648735?page=0\" target=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/921322/14441195.52/0_9e61f_84319983_L.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"\nborder=\"0\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169134/view/648736?page=0\" target=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/893904/14441195.52/0_9e620_7b8e68e8_L.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"\nborder=\"0\"/></a>\n<a href=\"https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169134/view/648734?page=0\" target=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/893904/14441195.52/0_9e61e_bcaa7a87_L.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"\nborder=\"0\"/></a>\n\n## Parking habits\n\nI have mentioned electrical heaters Finns use for cars. This also developed a habit to park in front direction. I follow\nmy Moscow pattern but in general back parking happens here less often.\n\n<a href=\"https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/toivonens/album/169134/view/648732?page=0\" target=\"_blank\"><img\nsrc=\"https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/892397/14441195.52/0_9e61c_9ade64ef_L.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\"\nborder=\"0\"/></a>\n\n## News in Finnish\n\nFinnish national television and radio group issues daily news in the simplified Finnish language. They are making short\nsentences, use regular words and speak slowly. This news you can find at the television website or as a podcast. If I\nremember correctly, on the website there are even transcripts. If your level does not yet allow you to listen, you can\nfollow the text. Also, if you want, the other way around, make it more challenging, after listening to the simplified\nversion, you can turn on the regular one. In there, the language is normal and speed is as in usual conversation. These\ntwo are not 100% similar, but it is still the same context. Knowing what are the topics, you will get the regular news\neasier.\n\nYou can find Finnish news in simplified language [in iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/fi/podcast/yle-uutiset-selkosuomeksi/id994123795?mt=2https://itunes.apple.com/fi/podcast/yle-uutiset-selkosuomeksi/id994123795?mt=2).\n\n## In previous episodes\n\nInterested?
