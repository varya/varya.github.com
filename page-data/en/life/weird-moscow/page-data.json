This was a short visit after 2 years since I left the city for Amsterdam. I had some\nbusiness to do but there was also time for walking round the city. It has been changed a lot. However I still think that\ncoming in there with someone without Soviet Union background would surprise them in many cases.\n\nAfter I had came back to Helsinki I got a lot of questions like \"How is it in Moscow?\". Ok, in this post I will try to\nanswer.\n\n<excerpt/>\n\nMoscow (and I guess other Russian cities') airports do not have normal taxi system. Meaning, there is no special place\nwhere taxis wait in queue for their passengers. Instead, you face some people in the hall shouting \"taxi, taxi\". They are\nmostly swindlers trying to catch someone not familiar with the system and drive them for 5x or 10x price. Versed people\ncall for taxi by phone in advance, ask friends to drive them or use smartphone applications to order a cab. We did the\nlast. (Well, they say that there is official taxi somewhere, not the queue of cars but a place to order. Anyway we\ncouldn't find any sign pointing to it :-)\n\nIt seems that air in Moscow smells like exhaust everywhere. No wonder for 12-million city but quite a big difference\nwith Helsinki.\n\nIf you are lucky not to live in a hotel but surf a friend's couch or book a room/apartment, this is a good chance to\nlearn the people's life. If it happens to be outside the 3rd Ring Road, it may be in 17- or 20- floor building.\n\nNothing special inside. Besides, the bathtub is the must. Take the bubbles, the water is cheap.\n\nAlthough the taxi is still the most comfortable transport for moving around (besides the rush hour) and today's currency\nrate encourages to use it, try metro sometimes. It is extremely noisy, even at the lines with modern trains. But do put\nup. You may discover that train comes every 90 seconds. Then, the stations of the Ring Line and everything inside are\noften architectural and design masterpieces. When living in Moscow we used to give a guide book about Moscow underground\nto the couchsurfers. Yes, there are guide books with the most amazing routes of Moscow metro, like there are books for\nwalking round Paris and Amsterdam.\n\nWalking on Moscow streets has become better. It used to be challenging due to the cars parked on the pedestrian paths.\nThere is no such thing any more: higher fines and almost immediate evacuation do their part. But it is yet ordeal.\nStreets are sometimes enormously wide with rare crosswalks. Prepare to walk a lot, twice or thrice longer distances\nthan in usual touristy.\n\nYou will however be rewarded by a lot of cafes and restaurants on your way where you may have a short break. Remember\nthe favourable currency rate and don't miss a chance to taste something you don't get in your country. Not necessarily\nSlavic food, Central Asian cuisine is far more popular in Russia than in other places. Besides the -stan countries, of\ncourse.\n\nFor the risky ones I would recommend to rent a car. Or ask a local friend to drive you round the city if you are not\nthat brave. Driving in Moscow lets experience up to 120 km/h right on the city streets. If not such speed, it provides\ncharming mess of cars in 6-10 lanes with every driver sounding their horn at those who are frozen for a second.\n\nThe trip we got was just 3 days, 2nd of those was busy with the conference and the last was all used to a lazy\nget-to-the-airport. So, that's all for the tips yet. In the other cases you need to discover your own Moscow.\n","fields":{"slug":"en/life/weird-moscow/","disqusIdentifier":"life-weird-moscow-index-en","readingTime":{"minutes":3.205}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Weird Moscow","subTitle":null,"date":"03 September 2015","v2":true,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":null,"canonical":null,"cover":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://varya.me"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"en/life/weird-moscow/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
