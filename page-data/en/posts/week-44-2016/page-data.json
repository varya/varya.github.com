This is a mature but not yet\nimplemented idea. Although, a friend of mine [Vladimir Starkov sometimes practises the same](https://iamstarkov.com/).\n\nIn this issue there are tips on organizing Google Calendar, nice project management addition for GitHub, Styleguide\nsolutions for React projects and a couple of good reads.\n\n</div>\n\n## Week numbers in Google calendar\n\nIn Finland, the week numbers are widely used. People easily make agreements on let's say \"the beginning on week 45\". For\nthis purpose and also for the actual weekly reports, I have subscribed for a special Google calendar\nwhich provides a small week number at the top right corner or every monday.\n\n![](./CalendarWeekNumbers3.png)\n\nHere are the instructions:\n[http://www.daimto.com/how-to-add-week-numbers-to-your-google-calendar/](http://www.daimto.com/how-to-add-week-numbers-to-your-google-calendar/).\n\n## ZenHub — a GitHub issue tracker\n\n[ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) is an add-on, which makes different boards with columns on top of GitHub issues.\n\n![](./zenhub-task-board.jpg)\n\nIt looks like a competitor of embedded [GitHub\nProjects](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) but with\nmore features.\n\n## React Storybook and React Styleguidist\n\nIn the project I have started on Monday, we faced the need to document React components. There were two candidates\namong the tools to use — [React Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/) and [React\nStyleguidist](https://github.com/sapegin/react-styleguidist). Both with their pros and cons.\n\nBy now, we ended up with Styleguidist. Anyway, this is not a mature solution, and we can probably think back.\n\nThe Storybook was super easy to install. However, it requires more typing for every story and does not read the props out\nof the documenting comments.\n\nThe Styleguidist was a tricky thing to run. Everything goes smoothly at simple projects but this was not our case. There\nwere some difficulties with the pages wrapped into `react-hot-loader` container. I solved it by introducing proper file\nstructure. We should have it anyway. Now, there is a dedicated folder for the components and we taught the Styleguidist\nto work with it.\n\nAs a piece of advice to friends, I can give the following: try to reuse your normal webpack config and not to write another one\nin the `styleguide.config.js` file. It will save you some time when changing the building process. This is our version:\n\n```\nconst siteWebpack = require(\"./webpack.config.js\");\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  title: 'My Great Style Guide',\n  components: './src/components/**/*.jsx',\n  updateWebpackConfig(webpackConfig) {\n    siteWebpack.module.loaders.forEach(function(loader) {\n      webpackConfig.module.loaders.push(loader);\n    });\n    webpackConfig.postcss = siteWebpack.postcss;\n\n    return webpackConfig;\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## How to Write a Git Commit Message\n\nThe article [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams has already\nturned 2 years but still actual. I have read it previously and try to follow. But I do not recollect me shring the link\nto it. So, here it is.\n\n## 4 different kinds of React component style\n\nSetting up a new project I have scanned a lot of recent articles about React. One of them is [4 different kinds of React\ncomponent style](https://www.peterbe.com/plog/4-different-kinds-of-react-component-styles). I had doubts if to put it in\nthis blog post or not because it did not tell me much new. On the other hand, it's not a long read and finely summarizes\ndifferent kinds of React components.\n","fields":{"slug":"en/posts/week-44-2016/","disqusIdentifier":"posts-week-44-2016-index-en","readingTime":{"minutes":2.565}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Week 44, 2016","subTitle":null,"date":"08 November 2016","v2":true,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":{"desc":"TODO: Description\n"},"canonical":null,"cover":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://varya.me"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"en/posts/week-44-2016/","prev":{"id":"40bf7099-d33c-5a44-8fef-85b59eb400c4","fields":{"slug":"en/posts/sc5-style-guide-next-level/","disqusIdentifier":"posts-sc5-style-guide-next-level-index-en","level":1,"fileRelativePath":"sc5-style-guide-next-level/index_en.md","lang":"en","readingTime":{"minutes":7.095}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Living SC5 Styleguide, the next level","subTitle":null,"link":null,"v2":true,"old":null,"date":"2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z","layout":"post","tags":null},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/varya.github.com/varya.github.com/content/posts/sc5-style-guide-next-level/index_en.md"}},"next":{"id":"7133669b-96c2-5804-aea7-2682954657fb","fields":{"slug":"en/posts/react-redux-simple-project/","disqusIdentifier":"posts-react-redux-simple-project-index-en","level":1,"fileRelativePath":"react-redux-simple-project/index_en.md","lang":"en","readingTime":{"minutes":3.25}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Simple yet promising structure for React/Redux project","subTitle":null,"link":null,"v2":true,"old":null,"date":"2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z","layout":"post","tags":null},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/varya.github.com/varya.github.com/content/posts/react-redux-simple-project/index_en.md"}},"fileSourceUrl":"https://github.com/varya/varya.github.com/edit/develop/content/posts/week-44-2016/index_en.md","frontmatter":{"title":"Week 44, 2016","date":"2016-11-08T00:00:00.000Z","v2":true,"layout":"post","meta":{"desc":"TODO: Description\n"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
