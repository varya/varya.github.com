Assuming that Elisa is a huge mobile operator with a lot of websites and a need\nto keep those websites visually consistent, there is no wonder that the SC5 Style Guide as a tool provides benefits\nthere. But what about smaller websites? Would it be useful there? I did not know the answer to this question\nand wanted to experiment. The experiment was conducted on my blog codebase.\n\n</div>\n\nThis is how the Living Style Guide looks like: [varya.me/styleguide](http://varya.me/styleguide). You can see the interface\ndecomposed into block pieces, each of those representing a meaningful interface unit. I haven't seen the interface of my blog\nfrom this perspective before. It gave me a lot of insight into the ways the CSS architecture of my blog should be designed.\nBut, let's consider things one by one.\n\n## Fine-tuning the SC5 Style Guide tool\n\nEverything starts with\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev sc5-styleguide\n```\n\nThen, I was able to use the tool to build the interface representation. It required\n[a couple of Gulp tasks](https://github.com/varya/varya.github.com/blob/af38b1fb0bd6e5a1b043d002ad5dbf107f17e6c1/Gulpfile.js).\n\nI had to deviate from the example configuration in a couple of places to make my Style Guide work as it does now. Let me\nname and explain these things.\n\n### Providing the `appRoot` parameter.\n\nAs I am hosting the Style Guide website not it the root folder but in a subfolder named `styleguide`, I inform the\ngenerator about that, so it can build the properly working app:\n\n```js\ngulp.task(\"styleguide:generate\", function() {\n\n  return gulp.src([\"desktop.blocks/**/*.css\"])\n    .pipe(styleguide.generate({\n      title: \"Varya.me Styleguide\",\n      appRoot: '/styleguide',\n      ...\n```\n\n### Providing scripts\n\nUnder the `extraHead` parameter I list all the additions needed. Some of my components\nneed JavaScript to function. It is indeed possible to ignore that and present\ntheir views only, but I wanted them to be exactly as they were used in the blog.\nThanks to `extraHead` I could supply any code needed. I used it to\nlink the same scripts that I have on my blog pages:\n\n```js\ngulp.task(\"styleguide:generate\", function() {\n\n  return gulp.src([\"desktop.blocks/**/*.css\"])\n    .pipe(styleguide.generate({\n      title: \"Varya.me Styleguide\",\n      ...\n      extraHead: [\n        '<script src=\"http://yandex.st/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js\"></script>',\n        '<script src=\"/desktop.bundles/index/index.min.js\"></script>',\n        ...\n      ]\n    ...\n```\n\nHowever, I needed yet another trick to make the scripts work properly. My components are written with `i-bem.js`\nframework which automatically initialises them on the `domReady` event. This is what I wanted for the static pages because the\ncomponents markup is in HTML document. But for the Style Guide, which is architecturally a SPA, this did not work. The components\nare rendered on the fly, and this obviously happens after `domReady`; that is why by default they stay\nuninitialized. So they should be initialized after they had been rendered. Luckily, the Style Guide\ntriggers an event on the `window` object named `styleguide:onRendered` every time a new component is re-rendered.\nBy handling this event, I managed to get the components initialized right after they appear on the page. This code is needed\nfor the Style Guide only, so I do not include it into the project bundle but provide as an additional script in the\nStyle Guide configuration:\n\n```\ngulp.task(\"styleguide:generate\", function() {\n\n  return gulp.src([\"desktop.blocks/**/*.css\"])\n    .pipe(styleguide.generate({\n      title: \"Varya.me Styleguide\",\n      ...\n      extraHead: [\n        ...\n        '<script src=\"/styleguide/i-bem__init_styleguide.js\"></script>'\n      ]\n    ...\n```\n\nYou can check how the JavaScript components are working with the block which is initially empty and renders the list\nof repositories after querying the GitHub API: [varya.me/styleguide/#/section/4.3](http://varya.me/styleguide/#/section/4.3).\nOr try out the Candies randomly built with JavaScript [varya.me/styleguide/#/section/5.1](http://varya.me/styleguide/#/section/5.1).\n\nThe last important thing to make JavaScript work is to use `disableEncapsulation: true` parameter. Normally the\nStyle Guide wraps each component in the ShadowDOM because it lets us developers write component CSS without\nworrying about affecting the Style Guide interface. But it also makes the components scoped from the JavaScript linked\nto the Style Guide website — including that additional JavaScript I showed above. By disabling the encapsulation, I made\nthe components to be inserted into the HTML page as they are, without any scoping. As for affecting the Style Guide\ninterface, in my case it will never happen as I use BEM and all my components are already \"encapsulated\" thanks to that methodology.\n\n### Hosting a static page\n\nThe SC5 Style Guide provides a development server which routes all the paths to its root. When hosting it outside, you\nshould care about the routing yourself as you would do for any other SPA. But my blog is hosted on GitHub Pages\nwhich is a simple static hosting and does not provide any routing capabilities. For managing this case, I use the\n`disableHtml5Mode: true` option. It makes the Style Guide application generate the old-school links with `#`. And so it\nworks.\n\n## Documenting the components\n\nAs I used BEM for my website frontend from very beginning, the CSS was already written the component-way. I only\nneeded to create a descriptive structure and document the blocks with KSS.\n\n### Structuring the code\n\nUnfortunately the BEM way of storing components in folders turned out to be not good enough to see\nthe code from the living-style-guide perspective. On a file system, all the components are represented at the same\nlevel which turns them into a long list without much structure:\n\n```\ndesktop.blocks/\n├── article\n├── articles-list\n├── box\n├── ...\n└── text\n```\n\n[github/varya/varya.github.com/desktop-blocks](https://github.com/varya/varya.github.com/tree/af38b1fb0bd6e5a1b043d002ad5dbf107f17e6c1/desktop.blocks)\n\nIn this case the atomic components are not distinct from the structural interface pieces (such as Header or Footer),\nfrom the side blocks, or from CSS provided to style third-party things. Flat structure is indeed good for\nbundling tools but we humans need more logical nesting.\n\nFor that I provide the `overview.css` file, which has nothing to do with the final product and only helps me arrange the\nblocks. I have 5 sections, in which I place the blocks depending on what they are:\n\n```\n/*\nAtoms\n\nStyleguide 1\n\nstyleguide:ignore:start\n\n@import url(\"logo/logo.css\"); // 1.1\n@import url(\"text/text.css\"); // 1.2\n...\n\nstyleguide:ignore:end\n*/\n\n/*\nMain blocks\n\nStyleguide 2\n\nstyleguide:ignore:start\n\n@import url(\"header/header.css\"); // 2.1\n...\n\nstyleguide:ignore:end\n*/\n```\n\n[github/varya/varya.github.com/desktop-blocks/overview.css](https://github.com/varya/varya.github.com/blob/af38b1fb0bd6e5a1b043d002ad5dbf107f17e6c1/desktop.blocks/overview.css)\n\nThere are only comments in this file in which I provide the documentation of every subset as a Style Guide section.\nListing the paths of the dependant CSS files makes it easier to navigate through the code. The `@import` syntax is used just\nbecause :-)\n\nThe only trick here is the magic `styleguide:ignore:start` and `styleguide:ignore:end` keywords. It is possible to\nplace them inside comments in any piece of your CSS (or SASS or LESS) and make the Style Guide generator ignore\nwhat is in between.\n\nIn my case, I tell it skip my overview lists because they have nothing to do with the codebase. But the names of the\nsections and their possible descriptions (I just haven't provided any) are in work.\n\n### Describing the pieces\n\nEverything else went smoothly. For every component I provided the KSS description. The `logo` block can be the\nsimplest example:\n\n```css\n/*\n\nLogo\n\nmarkup:\n<logo class=\"logo\">···<b class=\"var\">var</b>·<b class=\"ya\">ya</b>;<b class=\"cursor\"></b></logo>\n\nStyleguide 1.1\n\n*/\n.logo\n{\n...\n```\n\n[github/varya/varya.github.com/desktop-blocks/logo/logo.css](https://github.com/varya/varya.github.com/blob/af38b1fb0bd6e5a1b043d002ad5dbf107f17e6c1/desktop.blocks/logo/logo.css)\n\nSee it rendered: [varya.me/styleguide/#/section/1.1](http://varya.me/styleguide/#/section/1.1)\n\nIn some other components I used extra features. For example, different social icons are the same `ico` element with different\nmodifiers. In the Style Guide I could documents them all together:\n\n```css\n/*\nSocial icon\n\n.social-ico__ico_type_rss         - RSS\n.social-ico__ico_type_twitter     - Twitter\n.social-ico__ico_type_github      - Github\n.social-ico__ico_type_facebook    - Facebook\n.social-ico__ico_type_linkedin    - LinkedIn\n\nmarkup:\n<a class=\"link social-ico__ico {$modifiers}\" href=\"#\" title=\"Icon title\"></a>\n\nStyleguide 1.5.1\n*/\n\n.social-ico__ico\n{\n...\n```\n\n[github/varya/varya.github.com/desktop-blocks/social-ico/social-ico.css](https://github.com/varya/varya.github.com/blob/af38b1fb0bd6e5a1b043d002ad5dbf107f17e6c1/desktop.blocks/social-ico/social-ico.css#L49)\n\nIn the website the component is rendered separately with every modifier possible:\n[varya.me/styleguide/#/section/1.5.1](http://varya.me/styleguide/#/section/1.5.1)\n\nFor the complex components which contain other ones I used `<sg-insert>` keyword. It takes another component's markup\nby its reference number.\n\n```css\n/*\nSidebar\nmarkup:\n<nav class=\"sidebar\">\n  <sg-insert>4.2</sg-insert>\n  <sg-insert>4.3</sg-insert>\n</nav>\nStyleguide 4.1\n*/\n\n.sidebar\n{\n...\n```\n\n[github/varya/varya.github.com/desktop-blocks/sidebar/sidebar.css](https://github.com/varya/varya.github.com/blob/af38b1fb0bd6e5a1b043d002ad5dbf107f17e6c1/desktop.blocks/sidebar/sidebar.css)\n\nThis makes the markup examples pretty short, however it expands for rendering the component and showing the\nmarkup on the website: [varya.me/styleguide/#/section/4.1](http://varya.me/styleguide/#/section/4.1)\n\n## Style-Guide-Driven Development\n\nIf you type \"logo\" in the Style Guide search field, it will find and render all the components where `logo` is found!\nThe search goes through all the CSS codebase. Similarly you can search for the components using `<em>` in their markup.\nOr `font:` in their CSS.\n\nI personally like that the search source is not only the CSS of components but also their markup examples. During the\nrefactorings this, for example, makes possible to select all the components containing inputs and look how the changes affect them.\n\nHowever this is just a small addition to one major benefit I see in using the Style Guide. I find it far more important\nthat **it reveals my mistakes**.\n\nI already used the component way when building my blog. And I was pretty sure that my BEM experience is a 100%\nguarantee that I get this right. But even developing with a highly modular approach in mind, I did this from the page perspective.\nBefore the components were integrated into the blog engine, I had developed a static page and this was where the\ncomponents fitted first.\n\nI considered them independent and so tried to write my code. But **sitting at the same page they never actually were\nindependent**.\n\nAfter the SC5 Style Guide magically represented each of them separately, I can see that the\n[logo](http://varya.me/styleguide/#/section/1.1) is aligned to the right.\nAnd why should it be? Obviously, my mistake when I tried to made it fit into the Header.\n\nThe same goes for the [language switcher](http://varya.me/styleguide/#/section/1.4) positioned on the right.\n\nIn the [set of social icons](http://varya.me/styleguide/#/section/1.5), the language switcher provided with the RSS\nicon was considered to stay with it. But this only happens because at the blog pages\nit is placed into a narrow container. The Style Guide represents it on its own and I can see that it is not that\nflawless as I thought.\n\nSuch discoveries obviously lead to the refactoring :-)\n\nTo top it off, I must say that the experiment does not end and there are already findings for further\nposts.
