With the team, we started this\nproject from scratch. This situation was the most suitable to practice the new technologies.\n\nThe stack I've tried was React + ES2015 + postcss + webpack. However, keeping in mind that most of the\nteam (who were supposed to maintain the project later) are mainly experienced in Angular, I was looking for some\nsort of combination of these frameworks.\n\n</div>\n\nFinally, I made a project with React used for the view and Angular governing the data layer. I\nbelieve that such project is ideal for the a bridge role. Often happens that the development team has a\nstrict deadline. There is no time to invent new rocket science approaches. However, we can introduce them gradually.\n\nFor that project, I decided that we can introduce React with ES2015. The project structure is easy to refactor\ninto a React-only project in the next iterations.\n\nI cannot share the exact code of the project, but I created a dummy repository with the same structure:\n[varya/angular-react-stub](https://github.com/varya/angular-react-stub).\n\nA new project may be forked/copied from it. After installation of the required npm packages, the development starts with\nrunning\n\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nIt starts a local server that builds of html, js and css files related to the project. The magic\nhappens with `webpack`. Let me explain it below.\n\nFor now, let's concentrate on the file structure.\n\nA human produced code of the project is placed in the `src` folder.\n\n```\nsrc/\n\n  _helpers/\n\n  modules/\n    menu/\n      menu.component.js\n      menu.css\n\n  pages/\n    contact/\n      contact.ctrl.js\n      contact.html\n\n  index.html\n  index.js\n```\n\nThe [index.js](https://github.com/varya/angular-react-stub/blob/3870766a28adb61fc2f1fc86fbfbe538c00da1f9/src/index.js) file\nis 'entering point' of the building process. Here, the webpack finds out what the modules required for the\napp are.\n\nIn this file, I create an Angular application and define the rules for routing. Roughly, each routing path corresponds\nto its page. It takes a page template (an `html` file) and a page controller (a `js` module), and make them work\ntogether.\n\nTo keep everything neat, I made `pages` folder, where each page has a subfolder with a template\nand a controller.\n\nThe controller is normal Angular code. It manipulates the data for future usage in the view. Also, controller is\nresponsible for extraction the data fromthe server and any transformation of it.\n\nHowever, the given example contains no such\nheavy code. Anyway, you can see how the `$scope` is filled in\n[pages/components/components.ctrl.js](https://github.com/varya/angular-react-stub/blob/3870766a28adb61fc2f1fc86fbfbe538c00da1f9/src/pages/components/components.ctrl.js).\n\nThe data from `$scope` is accessible in the template. From [pages/components/components.html](https://github.com/varya/angular-react-stub/blob/3870766a28adb61fc2f1fc86fbfbe538c00da1f9/src/pages/components/components.html)\nyou can see how it is passed down to the only used Angular directive, `react-component`. This directive is a bridge\nbetween Angular-cooked data and React-operated view. In the directive you declare what React component to render and\npass the properties to it. After that, the React component operates independently from the Angular.\n\n## Modules\n\nThere is a special `modules` folder at the same level as `pages`. It contains all the React modules used in the\napplication. The modules can be complex and include other modules. However, the file structure is flat. Each component\nis represented by a folder with its JavaScript file and any other related content inside. Often, it is CSS, however\nthe pictures and other required stuff may be in the same folder.\n\nYou can check out a typical component code in the file\n[modules/menu/menu.component.js](https://github.com/varya/angular-react-stub/blob/3870766a28adb61fc2f1fc86fbfbe538c00da1f9/src/modules/menu/menu.component.js).\n\nNote that the required CSS is imported in the JavaScript as\n\n```\nimport styles from './menu.css';\n```\n\nThis is one of the webpack's features which makes developing with it so awesome. A component declares the CSS it uses.\nThen, the bundled CSS is built according to these declarations. In refactoring, the process will\nautomatically exclude out-of-date CSS if its module is no longer in use.\n\n[webpack.config.js](https://github.com/varya/angular-react-stub/blob/3870766a28adb61fc2f1fc86fbfbe538c00da1f9/webpack.config.js)\nstores the data what files to process and how to do it.\nIt gets the file types from their extensions. Thus, `*.js` and `*.jsx` files are ES2015 and transform\ninto plain JavaScript. `*.html` files are inserted as raw strings. This is why they can be used as Angular templates.\n`*.css` files are required as styles but first transform with Postcss. I also use `precss` as a plugin, which\nmakes possible to enjoy most of the usual pre-processing features.\n\nThis covers pretty much all about the basic structure. A real project can use external libraries and modules as\nwell as have more complex building process. But here is its starting point: [varya/angular-react-stub](https://github.com/varya/angular-react-stub/).\n","fields":{"slug":"en/posts/react-angular-project/","disqusIdentifier":"posts-react-angular-project-index-en","readingTime":{"minutes":3.65}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Simple React Angular project","subTitle":null,"date":"19 May 2016","v2":true,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":{"desc":"The detailed explanation of React+Angular starting project.
