Together, they go through the iterative\ndesign process and build modular UI for the product. Teams implement a pattern library using React and optionally\nstyled-components, and document it with Storybook. The exercise contains managing collaborative updates and keeping\nthe code in sync with the design reality. By the end of the day, each team has the product ready, built with the\nhelp of their library, and driven by an effective process to ensure smooth updates.\n\n<Workshop/>\n\n### Workshop contains\n\n- Introduction to the topic of design systems;\n- Creating a visual design language via UI inventory exercise;\n- Going through the iterative design process involving team members of different disciplines;\n- Working on React UI library;\n- Practicing styled-components;\n- Using styleguide-driven development for code production;\n- Training design system release process;\n- Building a product based on the given design system;\n- Providing brand changes to the product via the design system.\n\n<summary>Open full workshop description</summary>\n\n##### Workshop Details\n\nDive into the world of Design Systems through Storybook and React. You will be\na part of a multidisciplinary team with your focus either on development or\ndesign. Together, you will create a well-documented pattern library and build a\nmodular website out of its components as a final product.\n\nIn the workshop, we will start by creating a visual design language for the\nteam to share. Together, you will go through the iterative design process and\nbuild modular UI for the product. You will implement a pattern library using\nReact and optionally styled-components, and document it with Storybook. The\nexercise contains managing collaborative updates and keeping the code in sync\nwith the design reality. By the end of the day, you will have the product\nready, built with the help of your library, and driven by an effective process\nto ensure smooth updates.\n\nThis workshop is all about hands-on doing and somewhat about development, but\nno pattern library can be built without design or designer, so ideal team will\nconsist of both. A designer and a developer can, of course, co-exist in the\nsame person ðŸ™‚ For people with the development mindset some prior experience in\nReact or ES6, and CSS is appreciated.\n\nTo participate in the workshop, you will need your own laptop. As a developer\nor as a designer-developer, you should also have your favorite IDE installed.\n\nThe workshop is held at Nordcloud Helsinki Office. You will be in the capable\nof hands of our design system experts Varya Stepanova, Rami Ertimo, Junaid\nRasheed and Mikko Rajala. Other Intergalactico colleagues will offer a helping\nhand when needed. Teams of about five people will be formed during the\nworkshop. You can come alone or with your friend.\n\nWe will serve breakfast, lunch, and coffee + snacks to keep you going the whole day. See you at the Workshop!\n\n##### Why Attend\n\n- Creating a pattern library is one of the crucial tools for making a living\n  design system. Design system is all about communication, and pattern library\n  can only be built and iterated with a collaborative team.\n- During the day you will learn key points how to start creating a pattern\n  library, how to make it living, and how to utilize it to create and change\n  product designs.\n\n##### For Whom\n\nAnyone interested in getting hands-on experience in creating a pattern library\nfor a design system. Ideal team consists of designers and developers, but\nanyone with interest in pattern libraries is welcome.\n\n##### Content\n\n- How to define and name patterns in a consistent manner\n- How to rapidly kickstart a pattern library with Storybook\n- How to use a pattern library in a product\n- How to make changes to a pattern library in a coordinated fashion\n\n##### Source: [Original workshop page](https://dsconference.com/ws-intergalactico/)\n\nPublically, this workshop was\ngiven twice - as a part of DFConf Helsinki, and the second time on its own.\n\n#### [At Design Systems Conference](https://dsconference.com/ws-intergalactico/)\n\nOn the 15th of March 2018, the workshop gathered 30 attendees. Working in 6 teams, by the end of the day they delivered\n6 different design systems expressed in React code and provided instant brand changes with the help of them.\n\n#### [At Intergalactico](https://www.intergalactico.io/ds-workshop-2018)\n\nThis time, on 12th of June 2018, 5 teams worked hard to dive into design systems thinking and componentized development.\n\n### Hands-on workshop for you\n\nVarious editions of this workshop were also used in a range of private workshops I gave for\n[Intergalactico](https://www.intergalactico.io/) clients. If you are interested in such kind of workshop tailored for\nyour organization, feel free to [email me to mail@varya.me](mailto:mail@varya.me). I am also open to run similar workshops at design or\ndevelopment conferences.\n","fields":{"slug":"design-systems/hands-on-workshop/","disqusIdentifier":"design-systems-hands-on-workshop","readingTime":{"minutes":4}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hands-on with design systems","subTitle":"Intensive workshop for a multidisciplinary team or teams","date":null,"v2":null,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":{"desc":"In the workshop, teams start by creating a visual design language to share.
