During the workshop, the participants get an introduction into the concept of design systems, study the existing solutions and apply them in the context of their company/project. The workshop exercises offer to practice basic design processes when creating and maintaining your own design system.\n\nEver wondered what is a design system and how is it different to a component library? Or how to introduce a design system to your product or organisation? This one day workshop will help your multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers, and project managers to get familiar with design systems, find design-related issues in your product, and understand how to work around them by improving product-related communication.\n\nDuring this workshop participants will get a hands-on experience with basic design processes while creating and maintaining their own design system. You'll learn how following these processes helps with establishing a well documented universal design\nlanguage which reflects a shared understanding of the brand and translates into the\ndesign-system implementation in code and design tools.\n\nWith the knowledge of communicational practises and modern design and developer's tools you too should be able to introduce a design system in your company and star working smarter, not harder.\n\n### Workshop contains\n\n- Introduction to the topic of design systems;\n- Analyze!
