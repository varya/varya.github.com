However, usually,\nthere is a difference. A design system bridges the gap between disciplines and between the teams across the organization, so\nit requires involvement of all those stakeholders and their mutual contribution. To make this the most successful, a\nDesign System needs transparent processes and tools communicating these processes to all the people involved.\n\nAccording to a research I made in several organizations,\nthe lack of information is the most painful point for\nthe usual Design System users. Even well-documented Design Systems face this problem. Often a potential design-system\ncontributor does not have a focus on Design Systems as a concept and experience in maintaining the\nlibraries. At the same time, these representatives of the projects using Design Systems are the most important people to\nbe involved. Developing the actual projects, they have the most knowledge about the business needs of the company\napplications and are much more connected to the users than abstract design-system developers. Making these people\nsmoothly contribute to the Design System ensures its coverage, actuality, and instant expanding as well as saves the\nresources. This can be achieved with a very detailed guidance not only for the technical or design aspects of the Design\nSystem but also for its processes.\n\nTo start contribution, it is crucial to have a clear vision what to do in specific situations and have a support for\nmaking decisions. This aspect is being actively discussed in the community and some offer their solutions, for example,\nBrad Frost presents a decision tree:\n\n<Image caption=\"Image source: Maintaining Design Systems, http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/\">\n![](./pattern-addition-flowchart.png)\n</Image>\n\nBelow, I show an altered version in a form of an interactive component. This is a visual illustration of what happens to a\npattern on its way from identifying the need to actual implementation and how different the path might be depending on the\nsituation.\nThis process is called **Pattern Journey**.\n\n## Pattern Journey - Interactive Scheme\n\nThe scheme shows possible paths from identifying the need in a pattern to implementing it. Answers to the displayed questions help to\nchoose the right way. Note that **you can click on the questions** to get additional guidance on how to get the answer.\nFor a specific project, the instructions can be more detailed and contain links to communication channels, pages of\ndocumentation, repositories, Abstract spaces or Dropbox.\n\nIn the video, you can see how it works.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kKnTN3EswnU\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Examples of paths through Pattern Journey\n\nThe patterns make different journeys if it is a completely new UI element, changing or expending the existing one or\nmigrating from a project to the library. Let me show you some (but not all situations). In each of them, a potential\ncontributor starts from the top of the scheme and goes further navigated with the questions and answers to them. The\nadditional text is what they see in the popup when they are wondering how they should find an answer to the questions.\n\n### Implementing a new component\n\n![](./pattern-journey__pattern-library--implement-new.png)\n\nTakes steps are:\n\n#### 1. Is the pattern in the library?\n\nYou can search for patterns at the <i>Design System / Pattern Libarary website</i>.\nFigure out what could be a name or a keyword for the pattern you are looking for, and use if in the website search.\n\nIf you don't find anything suitable, you can also ask other people in the\n<i>instant communication channels</i> like Slack / Flowdock / Mattermost etc.\n\nAnswer: _No. There is no pattern in the library._\n\n#### 2. Anything similar at other projects?\n\nAsk around if people at other projects implement anything similar. You can instantly ask in the\ninstant communication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc)\nor raise this quesion in regular Design or Develoment meetings. Also, you can ask people directly.\n\nAnswer: _No. I could not find anything similar._\n\n#### 3. Can it be used by other projects in the future?\n\nIs there future need for such component at other projects? Discuss this with the other teams, and\ndo this publically in the\ncommunication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc).\nYou can also ask people directly or raise this question at regular cross-company Design or Development meetings.\n\nAnswer: _Yes. There are at least two more teams interested in the pattern._\n\n#### 4. Implement the pattern\n\nIt seems that you need to add this pattern into the\nDesign System / Pattern Library.\nTo start with process, usually you need to create a ticket in the task tracker system\n(JIRA, Trello, etc) and/or communicate about what you are going to do directly to the people.\nFollow the workflow for implementing new patterns which usually includes task flow, communication standards and code style.\n\n_Wait for release_\n\n#### 5. Use it\n\nYour desired pattern is already a part of the Design System / Pattern Library. Check the\n<i>Design System / Pattern Library website</i>\nfor its documentation.\nUse the component as it is documented. If you have question, do not hesitate to ask in the\ninstant communication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc).\nThe suggestions and pull requests for the documentation improvement are very welcome.\n\n### Taking the pattern from another project\n\n![](./pattern-journey__pattern-library--from-other-project.png)\n\n#### 1. Is the pattern in the library?\n\nAnswer: _No. There is no pattern in the library._\n\n#### 2. Anything similar at other projects?\n\nAnswer: _Yes. The is similar pattern at other project._\n\n#### 3. Can you take it as it is?\n\nCan you borrow the code of this component and use it without any change? So that both you and the \"donor\" project would\nbe using the same code?\n\nAnswer: _No. It is similar to what I need but I have to alter it._\n\n#### 4. Do other teams ready to use new altered version?\n\nIf you change the existing component so that it meets your requirements,\nare the current users of it able to use the altered version?\nAsk them directly or raise this question publically. As usual,\nyou can communicate in the\ncommunication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc).\n\nAnswer: _Yes. They are happy with my changes._\n\n#### 5. Implement the pattern\n\n_Wait for release_\n\n#### 6. Use it\n\n### Fix existing pattern\n\n![](./pattern-journey__pattern-library--fix-pattern.png)\n\n#### 1. Is the pattern in the library?\n\nAnswer: _Yes. I found its documenttaion and examples._\n\n#### 2. Does it fulfill all the requirements?\n\nStudy the pattern documentation at the\n<i>Design System / Pattern Library website</i>\nand all the examples provided. This way, you can understand if the pattern is suitable\nfor your specific task.\n\nIf there is no example covering your case, but you suppose that it is still possible\nwithout changing its code, play around with example HTML. For confirmation, ask in the\npeople in communication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc)\nif the pattern examples can be extended with your case. If they can, it would be nice if you\nmake a pull request illustrating your specific usage.\n\nAnswer: _No. It is close what I need but I need extended functionality._\n\n#### 3. Can it be changed to suit your new requirements while still fitting existing requirements?\n\nFigure out the requirements for the existing component based on the documentation and examples. If you have doubts, ask in the\ninstant communication channels (Slack, Flowdock, etc), at regular meetings\nor in person.\n\nDoes it look that you can provide changes and the component will not be broken in the places it is used now?\n\nAnswer: _Yes. I can provide changes, and nothing will be broken._\n\n#### 4. Implement the pattern\n\n_Wait for release_\n\n## Usage\n\nThis decision helper is meant to be a part of a Design System documentation. Being a React component it can be easily\naltered due to the needs of a specific company or product. Similarly, it can be constantly updated while the processes\nin the Design System are changed and shapen.\n","fields":{"slug":"design-systems/pattern-journey/","disqusIdentifier":"design-systems-pattern-journey","readingTime":{"minutes":6.605}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Pattern Journey","subTitle":"A process of maintaining and extending design systems","date":null,"v2":null,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":{"desc":"Visual illustration and explanation of what happens to a pattern on its way from identifying to actual implementation and how different the path might be depending on the situation.
