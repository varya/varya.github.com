The day before the\nconference, there was a traditional dinner for speakers. I like this tradition as it makes possible for us speakers to\nmeet our fellows and the conference organizers so that the next days we work as a team to provide the very best event. As\nusual, we were asking each other what the talks are about. When it was my turn, I started to explain that my talk is\ngoing to be about building infrastructure for a design system and particularly a design system website. One person\ninterrupted me with a question \"A style guide?\". And that is the key issue. Many people think that **design systems**\nare\nequal to **style guides**. But they are much more, they must be much more. On this page, I show what is a design system from\ndifferent perspectives: design, development, project and even business.\n\n</i>\n\n![](thumb.png)\n\n## What is a design system for me?\n\nWe can have a look at who are the actual or potential users of design systems, and what are their professional needs in\nthis context.\n\n<ImageBlock margin={{vertical: \"medium\"}} image={<ProjectRoles role=\"developer\" />}>\n\nDesign systems are often understood as libraries of components. In this regard, the developers are seeing the system\nmostly from this perspective. Developers would like to have documentation for every component, examples of usage and\nmaybe explanation of the implementation details. Apart from that, they would need information related to the whole\nsystem. Such as release notes, instructions for linking the library to the project, etc. For contribution, they need to\nknow what is the library code style and contribution policy. To give feedback, they need the contact information of the design system team and/or access to relevant boards or chats.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n<ImageBlock imageRight margin={{vertical: \"medium\"}} image={<ProjectRoles role=\"designer\" />}>\n\nDesigners also need documentation for every pattern, especially the reasons behind them. Other design-related\ndocumentation such as color palette, spacing examples, tone of voice, and many more helps them to create new patterns\nwhich are coherent with the rest of the system. They also need information about how to collaborate with other fellow\ndesigners and what are the tools to use. Designers are interested in seeing their creations alive, thus they\nneed to know how the process goes further on the development and later stages.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n<ImageBlock margin={{vertical: \"medium\"}} image={<ProjectRoles role=\"owner\" />}>\n\nProject managers or owners need to have a basic representation of the design system since this is what is used to build the\ninterface for their product. They are also interested in release notes as in something that has been implemented. Apart from that, managers need to know the design system's nearest future or, in particular, what new components are going to be\nreleased and what are the upcoming changes to the existing ones. For that, managers need to see the design system's\nroadmap and learn its strategy as well as be able to discuss this with the relevant people.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n<ImageBlock imageRight margin={{vertical: \"medium\"}} image={<ProjectRoles role=\"business\" />}>\n\nOn the business levels of the company, especially if speaking about mid-size or large companies, design systems are seen\nas internal products and tools. People of this specialization need to have a larger scale picture of the system.\nAlso, they must be especially interested into design system's meta information such as what is its impact, how it helps\nin-team and cross-team collaboration and maybe even the numbers of how much the company earns and saves thanks to the\ndesign system.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n## Design system â€” what is behind?\n\nDesign systems are yet evolving concept, our understanding of them is changing. But for sure a design system must serve the\nneeds of all the people involved in product creation and managing the company. This brings us to the conclusion that **a design\nsystem is not equal to a library of components or to a style guide, it is something bigger**. From my experience, a\nfunctioning and living design system means the following.\n\n#### Shared practices\n\n<ImageBlock margin={{vertical: \"medium\"}} image={<DsAspects aspect=\"shared-practices\"/>}>\n\nDesign system provides and documents shared practices, based on which you design your product or a bunch of products under\nthe same brand. A library of components and style guide as their documentation are such shared practices. However,\nshared practices are not limited to them but also include more abstract or more design related things such as visual\nlanguage or tone of voice. Or on the contrary, they can be deeply technical and reflect your approach to code (aka code\nstyle).\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n#### Tools\n\n<ImageBlock margin={{vertical: \"medium\"}} image={<DsAspects aspect=\"tools\"/>}>\n\nThis brings us to the tools which our company could have for all the developers and designers to share. This means\nprofessional software to use and its plugins, scripts for processing and optimizing visuals and code, development and\ndesign environment, etc.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n#### Processes\n\n<ImageBlock margin={{vertical: \"medium\"}} image={<DsAspects aspect=\"processes\"/>}>\nAt the next level, design systems would mean the processes which are followed in the company to achieve the outlined\ngoals. Often spoken that design systems bridge the gap between specializations. This means that the design system should\nestablish the processes in teams or even on the company level.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n#### Community\n\n<ImageBlock margin={{vertical: \"medium\"}} image={<DsAspects aspect=\"community\"/>}>\nThe processes bring us to those for whom they are created, or to the people. As mentioned above, design systems ensure multidisciplinary collaboration and are meant to help the working collective as a whole. In this regard, having a design\nsystem implies constant work with our fellow developers, designers and project owners as with a community.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n## Way to go\n\nA comprehensive design system would have all the aspects listed above; not only a style guide or a library but\ndocumentation and helpful tools for all the practices to follow, outlined and tuned processes for achieving the goals and\nhelping the routines as well as own community-related documentations, instruments, and actions.\n\nCreating and maintaining the design system is not limited to making visual designs and coding but does include service\ndesign, project and community management. Moreover, a design system tightly connected to brand and business of the company, so the\nmethods of running it have to be tailored for the specific organization and its teams. These are the topics for\nmany more articles and discussions (yet published [Maintaining design systems with proper user\nresearch](https://medium.com/elisa-design/maintaining-design-systems-with-user-research-3ba5feafc336) and presented\n[Building design systems that leverage your designers, developers, and\nproducts](http://varya.me/design-systems-thinking/)).\n\n<i>\n\nComing back to the story in very beginning, my talk was about documenting all the listed aspects at a company design\nsystem website and organizing the processes for its constant evolving: [slides](https://varya.me/react-finland-2019/),\n[video](https://youtu.be/gDkUpx0dVc0?t=9993).\n\n</i>\n\n![](./ds-infrastructure.png)\n\n##### Credits\n\nThis article is using icons made by [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) and\n[Eucalyp](https://creativemarket.com/eucalyp) from [www.flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com/).\nThey are licensed by\n[CC 3.0 BY](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\n","fields":{"slug":"design-systems/what-is-a-design-system/","disqusIdentifier":"design-systems-what-is-a-design-system","readingTime":{"minutes":5.66}},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is a design system?","subTitle":"And why it is more than just a library or a style guide","date":null,"v2":null,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":{"desc":"The concept of design systems is much wider than how it is often understood.
