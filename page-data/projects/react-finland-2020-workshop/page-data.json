In the workshop, the participants saw the value of common language and well-organized co-creation process, practiced UI inventory, and learned the different shapes of design systems as well as how to choose the most suitable one.\n\nEver wondered what is a design system and how is it different to a component library? Or how to introduce a design system to your product or organisation? This one day workshop will help your multi-disciplinary team of designers, developers, and project managers to get familiar with design systems, find design-related issues in your product, and understand how to work around them by improving product-related communication.\n\nDuring this workshop participants will get a hands-on experience with basic design processes while creating and maintaining their own design system. You'll learn how following these processes helps with establishing a well documented universal design\nlanguage which reflects a shared understanding of the brand and translates into the\ndesign-system implementation in code and design tools.\n\nWith the knowledge of communicational practises and modern design and developer's tools you too should be able to introduce a design system in your company and star working smarter, not harder.\n\n<Link to=\"https://www.component-driven.dev/offerings/ds101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Workshop description at component-driven.io</Link>\n","fields":{"slug":"projects/react-finland-2020-workshop/","disqusIdentifier":"projects-react-finland-2020-workshop","readingTime":{"minutes":1.075}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Workshop at React Finland 2020","subTitle":null,"date":"25 May 2020","v2":null,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":null,"canonical":null,"cover":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://varya.me"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"projects/react-finland-2020-workshop/","frontmatter":{"title":"Workshop at React Finland 2020","date":"2020-05-25T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A remote workshop on the design, managerial, and communication aspects of design systems.
