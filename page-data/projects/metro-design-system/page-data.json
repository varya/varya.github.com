That role also includes elements\nof service design and managing the project.\n\n## Data-driven approach and OKRs\n\nThe project goals are set and tracked by the [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) framework.\nMainly, the focus of design system team was to increase the adoption of its\nproducts (libraries of components implemented in different technologies) across the\ncompany. Such an approach assumed creating and constant usage of the metrics system.\nThe metrics such as amount of products using different libraries and amount of library\ncomponents used in these products â€” are frequently and regularly analysed to find out\nthe potential gaps and forward the team focus to close them.\n\n## Marketing and in-house community management\n\nAs a head of the product, I ensure its usage within the company and popularity in the\ndesign and development circles. While the usage of the design system is not mandatory,\nit turns out to be very important that people use it on their own will and, at first,\nget familiar with it. As specific actions towards this goal, I commit the following:\n\n- Representing the design system to the business levels and communicating its value and impact\n- Presenting and reminding about the design system in company's design and development forums\n- Regular onbording meeting for recently joined engineers\n- Processing the other teams' request to meet their expectations\n\n## Service design for a design system\n\nProject innovations are driven and tackled by applying service design techniques such as:\n\n- User research\n- Ideation\n- Prototyping\n- Facilitation\n\n## Achivements and the overcome challenges\n\n- New library of Web Components<br/>\n  The team has sucessfully built a library of Web Components that enabled products to\n  integrate them regardless of a framework they are using on the frontend.\n- Defined workflows<br/>\n  The workflows for both design system team operations and contributions are now defined,\n  visualised and documented. These artifacts are huge help in guidance for the new and old team members. They also enable and encorage contributions to the design system.\n- Onboarding as a regular activity<br/>\n  Through constant enganging activity, [the onboarding session has became a known regular\n  event in the company calendar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6896797119584329728/). Gradual update of the presented materials ensures meeting\n  the needs of the newcomers so that they get relevant information about a design system which makes their working path with it easier and smoother. In turn, that ensures that the design system is known among the developers and widely adopted in the product codebases.\n- Outlined security policy<br/>\n  In a series of workshops, the team has made initial audit of resources and tools in\n  the context of potential security threats. The structed representation of the artifacts, risks, their impacts, countermeasures to them and respond actions clearly communicates to all the team members what they should be aware of and how they should act in different scenarios.\n","fields":{"slug":"projects/metro-design-system/","disqusIdentifier":"projects-metro-design-system","readingTime":{"minutes":2.59}},"frontmatter":{"title":"METRO Design System","subTitle":null,"date":"01 June 2021","v2":null,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":null,"canonical":null,"cover":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://varya.me"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"projects/metro-design-system/","frontmatter":{"title":"METRO Design System","date":"2021-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Metro Design System is a multiperspective product for designers and developers that helps them create digital experience for millions of METRO customers in 22 countries.\n"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
