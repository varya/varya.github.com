Together, we created an innovative design system that not only ensured a seamless user experience but also brought brand coherence across the entire product range.\n\n## Basic Guidelines\n\nOne of the cornerstones of our project was the development of comprehensive design system documentation. By formulating clear and concise guidelines, we provided a roadmap for consistent user interfaces and brand representation. These guidelines served as a reference for the designers, ensuring that all future design work adhered to the established principles.\n\n## Tokens System\n\nTo streamline the design-to-development process, we introduced a design tokens system. Our team assisted the designers in adopting design tokens and aligned them with the component architecture. Despite multiple token modifications during component design and development, the seamless integration between tokens and components facilitated easy updates, minimizing any potential disruptions.\n\n## Basic Components Implemented as Web Components\n\nAs a testament to our commitment to versatility, we implemented the basic components of the design system as Web Components. These components served as both functional elements within the product and exemplars for future component creation and expansion of the design system. Our choice of Lit as the framework for Web Components ensured compatibility across various JavaScript frameworks.\n\n## Library of Components\n\nTo provide easy access and version control for the components, we established a versionized library. Leveraging the infrastructure provided by GitHub and utilizing GitHub Actions for continuous integration, we developed and deployed the library with efficiency and precision. The library, distributed as an npm package, is securely hosted on GitHub, ensuring seamless integration into the product(s).\n\n## Design System Documentation\n\nTo empower AppOmni's designers and developers, we crafted comprehensive documentation within Storybook and Confluence. This documentation covers global design system aspects, token usage, guidelines, and examples of implemented components. Additionally, we incorporated workflows for design system maintenance and future extensions, enabling the team to evolve the system effortlessly.\n\n## Streamlined Development Process\n\nWith a focus on enhancing efficiency, we set up a robust development process. Our team equipped the project with essential tools, automated processes, and integration capabilities such as continuous testing and continuous delivery. This seamless development pipeline maximized productivity and minimized potential bottlenecks.\n\n## Testing with Jest\n\nTo ensure the reliability and stability of our components, we implemented rigorous testing using Jest. This comprehensive testing framework allowed us to identify and rectify any issues promptly, guaranteeing a seamless user experience.\n\n## Visual Regression Testing\n\nAs part of our commitment to perfection, we incorporated visual regression testing into our development workflow. By comparing visual snapshots of components, we could detect any unintended visual changes, ensuring that the design system's integrity was maintained throughout updates and modifications.\n\n## Team Trainings and Knowledge Sharing\n\nTo foster a culture of continuous learning, our project embraced transparency and knowledge sharing. We conducted team trainings and organized special knowledge-sharing events, ensuring that the expertise gained during the project was effectively communicated to AppOmni's in-house designers and developers.\n\n## Design System Integration\n\nAs a testament to the success of our project, the design system components seamlessly integrated into AppOmni's extensive product codebase. This integration solidified the impact of our work, as the design system became an integral part of the entire product range, enhancing user experiences and brand consistency.\n","excerpt":"As the design system architect and technical project manager, I had the privilege of leading the Bridge-the-Gap team in an 11-month-long collaboration with AppOmni's designers and UI development team.

Such an approach assumed creating and constant usage of the metrics system.\nThe metrics such as amount of products using different libraries and amount of library\ncomponents used in these products — are frequently and regularly analysed to find out\nthe potential gaps and forward the team focus to close them.\n\n## Marketing and in-house community management\n\nAs a head of the product, I ensure its usage within the company and popularity in the\ndesign and development circles. While the usage of the design system is not mandatory,\nit turns out to be very important that people use it on their own will and, at first,\nget familiar with it. As specific actions towards this goal, I commit the following:\n\n- Representing the design system to the business levels and communicating its value and impact\n- Presenting and reminding about the design system in company's design and development forums\n- Regular onbording meeting for recently joined engineers\n- Processing the other teams' request to meet their expectations\n\n## Service design for a design system\n\nProject innovations are driven and tackled by applying service design techniques such as:\n\n- User research\n- Ideation\n- Prototyping\n- Facilitation\n\n## Accomplishments and Overcoming Challenges\n\n- Creation of a New Web Components Library<br/> \nAs a product owner and project manager, I guided my team to successfully engineer a comprehensive library of Web Components, enabling seamless integration into products regardless of the frontend framework they employ.\n\n- Workflow Definitions<br/>\n  I took the initiative to define and document the workflows for both our design system team operations and contribution. These visual and written artifacts provide vital guidance for both new and established team members, fostering a collaborative environment and encouraging contributions to the design system.\n\n- Regular Onboarding Sessions<br/>\n  Thanks to our continuous engagement, [the onboarding session has become a recognized recurring event on the company calendar](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6896797119584329728/).  regularly review and update the materials presented ensure the needs of newcomers are met, providing them with relevant information about our design system. This in turn facilitates their integration into our workflow and promotes wide adoption of the design system within product codebases.\n\n- Security Policy Development<br/>\n  Recognizing the importance of security, I organized a series of workshops where our team performed an initial audit of resources and tools in relation to potential security threats. By creating a structured representation of artifacts, risks, impacts, countermeasures, and response actions, I have enabled all team members to understand and effectively manage various security scenarios.\n","excerpt":"Metro Design System is a multiperspective product for designers and developers that helps them create digital experience for millions of METRO customers in 22 countries.

The clients, Huhtamaki, are global food packaging specialists, and were looking to enter the home delivery packaging space. However, this was a new space for them, so they needed our team to help them understand the home delivery space in order to produce an optimal packaging solution to maintain their strong position in the packaging domain.\n\nOver the span of 6 months, our team did a deep dive into all the aspects of food delivery. Our research led us to conclude that a strategic solution was needed, not a product one. Thus we proceeded to craft an ecosystem map and based on what we learned from our research, created a road map of concepts to lead our clients to a systemic solution that could succeed within the rapidly growing home delivery space.\n\n![Huhtamaki Logo](Huhta-Logo.png)\n\n## Project Overview\n\n<Box direction=\"row\" gap=\"large\">\n<Box basis=\"1/2\">\n\n#### MY ROLE\n\nIn this project, I was involed into collecting and alalysing qualitative data, processing\nthe quantitative data, organising the industry research (including connection to the industry\ntop players).<br/>\nAs an experienced public speaker, I conducted a full day workshop to sharpen the final\npresentation of the project.<br/>\nFrom the technical perspective, I took the part of preparing a Huhtamaki internal website which\npresented the results of both research and design phases of the project as well as an extensive\ndescription of how the project was going.\n</Box>\n<Box basis=\"1/2\">\n\n#### WORK AND DELIVERABLES\n\n- Domain and Future Trends Analysis\n- Long Term Strategic Approach\n- Extensive Research into User Behavior\n- Competitive Benchmarking & Design Concept\n- Design Workshops and Ideation\n- Deep dive into client’s manufacturing capabilities and existing product pipeline\n\n</Box>\n</Box>\n\n### The Team\n\n<Image caption=\"From L to R - Varya Stepanova, Adithya Varadarajan, Juho Viironen, Jialai Qian. We were a wonderfully diverse and multidisciplinary team with a mix of backgrounds ranging from a design strategist to a packaging designer and a material science expert.\">\n\n![](Huhtamaki_Team.jpg)\n\n</Image>\n\n## Overall Process\n\n<ImageBlock imageRight imageBasis=\"1/2\" image={<Box margin={{top: \"medium\"}} pad=\"small\"><Image>\n\n![](Huhtamaki_Research.jpg)\n\n</Image></Box>}>\n\n### Extensive Field Research to Understand Consumers\n\nOur very first step was to understand the food consumer perspective on delivery and packaging. To do this, our team took a deep dive into delivery and takeaway food in London, Berlin and Helsinki. We studied different delivery companies, take out from restaurants and stores, and also the various packaging types on offer through observations, secondary research and video observations of the delivery process. We also conducted interviews, both in person and remote, with people from 30 different countries, ranging from India to Kenya to Japan to the USA.\n\nThis helped us to really understand their behavior and preferences around food delivery. We also did extensive observational research of restaurant and store takeaway practices to understand preferences and trends there as well. Lastly, we also had a chance to speak to operators in the food delivery services domain, to understand their perspective as well.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n<ImageBlock imageBasis=\"1/2\" image={<Box margin={{top: \"medium\"}} pad=\"small\"><Image>\n\n![](Huhtamaki_Conferences.jpg)\n\n</Image></Box>}>\n\n### Conferences for a Deep Dive into the Delivery Industry\n\nWe understood that a successful solution would need a thorough understanding of the domain even beyond the consumer, and to enable this, we approached this three different perspectives: food delivery platform, food producer and packaging producer. We attended two conferences in London as well as a packaging seminar at Slush to understand more about the industry side. These were very useful to understand industry trends, as well as to identify potential strategic partners, depending on the solution.\n\nThese conferences also helped us get an understanding of what to expect from the home delivery space in the future, both short and medium term, while getting an idea of what the big players in the space were doing. These future trends really enhanced our understanding of what the domain needed.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n<Box background=\"accent-50\" pad=\"medium\" textAlign=\"center\" margin={{horizontal: \"auto\", vertica: \"medium\"}}>\n\n#### UNDERSTANDING THE KEY PLAYERS DRIVING HOME DELIVERY\n\n<Paragraph standout>Over the course of our research, a repeating theme that came up, was the growing presence of companies that specialized in providing delivery services as an external vendor for restaurants. This included companies like Uber Eats, Foodora, Deliveroo and more.</Paragraph>\n\n<Paragraph standout>As we delved deeper into these companies, we realized how much their presence simplifies life for restaurants who want to get into delivery. Restaurants no longer have to invest in resources who can handle delivery for them, as these companies provide the logistics, the payment gateways and the delivery agents who handle the whole process, allowing restaurants to focus on what they do best - make food.</Paragraph>\n\n<Paragraph standout>In addition, companies like Deliveroo, in order to ensure they maintained the optimal consumer experience which was a huge factor for their growth, were actually taking over the logistics of testing, procuring and supplying optimal packaging to the restaurants, thus becoming a one stop delivery enabler.</Paragraph>\n</Box>\n\n<ImageBlock imageBasis=\"1/2\" image={<Box margin={{top: \"medium\"}} pad=\"small\"><Image>\n\n![](Huhtamaki_Factory.jpg)\n\n</Image></Box>}>\n\n### Understanding Huhtamaki’s Capabilities on Site\n\nWe visited one of our client’s production facilities in Finland as well as a subsidiary office in India to get a better picture of where they stood in their ability to deliver optimal solutions for the delivery space.\n\nThis also helped us understand their current product offerings and the kind of customers they currently had. This allowed us to think of potential ways in which their existing technology and solutions could translate into the delivery space while also giving us a business perspective on their capabilities.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n<Box background=\"accent-50\" pad=\"medium\" width=\"large\" margin={{horizontal: \"auto\"}}>\n\n#### BASED ON OUR RESEARCH, OUR APPROACH CHANGED\n\n<Paragraph standout>The optimal solution wasn’t just about creating better packaging for home delivery as the client originally intended, it needed something much more comprehensive.</Paragraph>\n</Box>\n\n<ImageBlock imageRight imageBasis=\"1/2\" image={<Box margin={{top: \"medium\"}} pad=\"small\"><Image>\n\n![](Huhtamaki_Ideation.jpg)\n\n</Image></Box>}>\n\n### Crafting a Future Focused Strategic Solution\n\nOnce we had this understanding, we put on our ideation hats with our clients on board. We first put together a clear picture of the entire delivery ecosystem that helped visualize all the potential touch points that could be influenced via a strategic solution. Then we crafted a multi-step concept road map which included elements from product design, service design, internet of things (IoT) and co-creation.\n\nThe intent of this roadmap was to provide a strategic approach for the client that ensured they weren’t just catching up or reacting to the current state of the domain, but rather aligning with trends and setting themselves up for sustainable, long term, success.\n\n</ImageBlock>\n\n## Final Outcome\n\nThe final outcome - the detailed ecosystem, the long term solution roadmap and predictions on the future of food delivery - these are all protected by NDA with the client and cannot be shared. The gallery below features some elements of the process we took to get there and I’d be happy to discuss more about our thought process and rationale.\n\nIf you’d like to know more about the project, get in touch!
