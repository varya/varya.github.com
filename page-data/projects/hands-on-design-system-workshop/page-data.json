In the workshop, teams start by creating a visual design language to share. Together, they go through the iterative design process and build a modular UI for the product. Teams implement a pattern library using React and optionally styled-components, and document it with Storybook. The exercise contains managing collaborative updates and keeping the code in sync with the design reality. By the end of the day, each team has the product ready, built with the help of their library, and driven by an effective process to ensure smooth updates.\n\nThis workshop was given two times.\n\nAs a part of the [Design System Conference](https://dsconference.com/ws-intergalactico/), the workshop gathered 30 attendees. Working in 6 teams, by the end of the day they delivered 6 different design systems expressed in React code and provided instant brand changes with the help of them.\n\nLately, the workshop was run as a separate event in [Intergalactico design studio](https://www.intergalactico.io/). That time, 5 teams worked hard to dive into design systems thinking and componentized development.\n\nThis work was done together with my amazing colleagues [Rami Ertimo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rami-ertimo/), [Mikko Rajala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikko-rajala/), [Antti Salo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antti-salo-10063295/), and others.\n","fields":{"slug":"projects/hands-on-design-system-workshop/","disqusIdentifier":"projects-hands-on-design-system-workshop","readingTime":{"minutes":1.035}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Workshop “Hands on with a design system”","subTitle":null,"date":"01 June 2018","v2":null,"old":null,"tumblr":null,"tags":null,"meta":null,"canonical":null,"cover":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"siteUrl":"https://varya.me"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"projects/hands-on-design-system-workshop/","frontmatter":{"title":"Workshop “Hands on with a design system”","date":"2018-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","description":"A full-day workshop about building a design system and a pattern library in a multidisciplinary team.
