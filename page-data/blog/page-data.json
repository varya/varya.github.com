The first step in effective versioning is assigning each version of your design system with a unique version number. This allows you to easily identify which version of your system someone is using, and track changes over time. Good practice dictates that you use semantic versioning for this purpose, which assigns each version a three-part code (e.g., 1.2.3). The major number indicates major changes or updates (e.g., new features), the minor number indicates minor changes or bug fixes, and the patch number indicates minor bug fixes or other small improvements to existing features.

Having a changelog that documents each update is essential for tracking progress over time. The changelog documents the updates, improvements and bug fixes made in each version of your design system.

Additionally, it\\u2019s important to communicate these changes with stakeholders so they understand why certain updates were made, as well as how they may affect the final product.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Finally, it is important to strive for backwards compatibility with each new release of your design system.

The initial idea was to release some of my time while my fellow developer helps me with coding challenges that belong to myself, not to the client projects. I interviewed ten developers who positioned themselves as juniors or middle-level developers. My special pride in the process is that there were no annoying coding questions and time-consuming trial tasks. I only spoke with each candidate for about half an hour. During those talks, I introduced myself, described my business and the potential projects, learned about the people. We discussed possible collaboration and compensation. The most important factor for me was a personal match. I was not worried about a possible lack of knowledge and experience: the end goal was to teach and guide. I must say that all the candidates I had in that round would very well fit the role. I would even qualify many of them as far more than juniors. Because of that, I based my decision on how much I could help my future-to-be employee and partner.

Besides, some parts of the project were implemented with NextJs and utilized GitHubActions. During this work, Ira and Nikita e-met, and we managed to work together in a small team.

Along the way, I had a chance to reflect on the social impact I make. The consultancy business is often represented as an opposition to product companies. Many say that as a consultant, you work for soulless companies rather than bring value to the people. But I believe that with the activity described above I discovered the opportunity to be useful. There are a lot of self-study people in IT (including myself) but I realise that not everyone has an opportunity to dedicate enough unpaid time for it. Men, people without kids and those who are financially supported by parents or partners win this race. My personal impact is that I can pay salaries for the less privileged while they are polishing their technical and product skills. Everyone wins: I have my projects done, my clients get helping hands whose work I approve and ensure the quality, a nearly senior developer comes to market. Together, as a whole humankind, we experience less inequality.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","excerpt":"Last year, I started my own consulting business.
