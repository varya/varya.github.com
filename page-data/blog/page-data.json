This process should include testing by both design and development teams before deployment, as well as communication with stakeholders regarding any changes that may affect functionality or usability in any way. Having these steps clearly outlined will help ensure that everyone is on board with releases before they go live, which can save time and money down the road.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Another practice is to use version numbers and semantic versioning. The first step in effective versioning is assigning each version of your design system with a unique version number. This allows you to easily identify which version of your system someone is using, and track changes over time. Good practice dictates that you use semantic versioning for this purpose, which assigns each version a three-part code (e.g., 1.2.3). The major number indicates major changes or updates (e.g., new features), the minor number indicates minor changes or bug fixes, and the patch number indicates minor bug fixes or other small improvements to existing features. This helps ensure everyone is on the same page when discussing different versions of your design system, as well as when tracking bugs or other issues with specific versions of the system.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Another important practice is to create a changelog and communicate changes. Having a changelog that documents each update is essential for tracking progress over time. The changelog documents the updates, improvements and bug fixes made in each version of your design system. This allows designers, developers, and stakeholders alike to look back at previous versions of components and see what has changed since then, making it easier to identify bugs and other potential issues. Additionally, it\\u2019s important to communicate these changes with stakeholders so they understand why certain updates were made, as well as how they may affect the final product.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Finally, it is important to strive for backwards compatibility with each new release of your design system. By ensuring backwards compatibility as much as possible, you minimize any potential disruptions that could occur due to unexpected updates breaking existing functionality in other products. This will help ensure that everyone is able to keep up with whatever changes may come down the line without having to worry about unexpected surprises along the way.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In conclusion, versioning your design system can seem like an intimidating task, but by following these best practices, you can have confidence knowing that everything will run smoothly when it comes time for making updates. Remember to use unique version numbers and semantic versioning conventions; create useful changelogs; communicate effectively with development teams; document life cycles; and strive for backwards compatibility will help ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible throughout every stage of production. With these strategies in place, you can rest assured knowing that every new iteration of your design system will be just as successful, if not more so, than its predecessor.\"), mdx(\"h3\", {\n    \"id\": \"more-articles-on-the-topic\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\"\n    }\n  }, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"h3\",\n    \"href\": \"#more-articles-on-the-topic\",\n    \"aria-label\": \"more articles on the topic permalink\",\n    \"className\": \"anchor before\"\n  }, mdx(\"svg\", {\n    parentName: \"a\",\n    \"aria-hidden\": \"true\",\n    \"focusable\": \"false\",\n    \"height\": \"16\",\n    \"version\": \"1.1\",\n    \"viewBox\": \"0 0 16 16\",\n    \"width\": \"16\"\n  }, mdx(\"path\", {\n    parentName: \"svg\",\n    \"fillRule\": \"evenodd\",\n    \"d\": \"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"\n  }))), \"More articles on the topic\"), mdx(\"ul\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"li\",\n    \"href\": \"https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/versioning-design-systems-48cceb5ace4d\"\n  }, \"Versioning Design Systems.

The initial idea was to release some of my time while my fellow developer helps me with coding challenges that belong to myself, not to the client projects. I interviewed ten developers who positioned themselves as juniors or middle-level developers. My special pride in the process is that there were no annoying coding questions and time-consuming trial tasks. I only spoke with each candidate for about half an hour. During those talks, I introduced myself, described my business and the potential projects, learned about the people. We discussed possible collaboration and compensation. The most important factor for me was a personal match. I was not worried about a possible lack of knowledge and experience: the end goal was to teach and guide. I must say that all the candidates I had in that round would very well fit the role. I would even qualify many of them as far more than juniors. Because of that, I based my decision on how much I could help my future-to-be employee and partner.

Unfortunately, I cannot share the project name and description until we release it. But tech-wise, for Ira, it was deeper learning and practicing of Gatsby, including its advanced features. Similar to re-making my website, this project required writing a library of React components, but some of them were far more complex. Besides, some parts of the project were implemented with NextJs and utilized GitHubActions. During this work, Ira and Nikita e-met, and we managed to work together in a small team. On the way towards client projects, a growing developer also needs to collaborate with others and try different workflows for such collaboration. That is as important as technical skills, if not more.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In the following gig, we stayed the course with gradual technological enhancement and considered the community impact.
