But when it comes to representation in UI, it might\nnot be trivial to iterate through all the deep levels. Often happens, that it is more useful to have\na flat structure which probably preserves the depth of the items. In JavaScript, easiest way to transform such structure is\n`reduce` method.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"small\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n<Image caption=\"Image source: https://macwright.org/2015/01/03/reduce-juice.html\">\n![](thumb.jpg)\n</Image>\n\n</div>\n\nSay, we have a nested structure representing the parts of a design system. This is a list of categories\nwith underlying item which, in turn, may have subitems.\n\n```javascript\nexport const parts = [\n  {\n    title: \"Visual language\",\n    parts: [\n      {\n        title: \"Color\",\n        parts: [\"Palettes\", \"Contrast\", \"Meaning\", \"Swatches\"],\n      },\n      {\n        title: \"Typography\",\n        parts: [\"Hierarchy\", \"Weights / types\", \"Web fonts\", \"Baseline grid\"],\n      },\n      \"Photography\",\n    ],\n  },\n  {\n    title: \"UI elements\",\n    category: true,\n    parts: [\n      \"Paragraph\",\n      \"Block quote\",\n      \"Headers (H1 - H6)\",\n      \"Lists\",\n      \"Links\",\n      {\n        title: \"Buttons\",\n        parts: [\"Primary\", \"Secondary\", \"Button groups\", \"Menu buttons\"],\n      },\n      \"Slider\",\n    ],\n  },\n];\n```\n\nInstead of going deeper and deeper, it's worth to flatten the structure with the help of `reduce` function, and then\niterate through the new structure.\n\n```javascript\nconst flatten = (obj, depth, currentDepth = 0) => {\n  const array = Array.isArray(obj) ? obj : [obj];\n  return array.reduce((acc, value) => {\n    acc.push({\n      title: value.title || value,\n      depth: currentDepth,\n    });\n    if (value.parts) {\n      acc = acc.concat(flatten(value.parts, depth, currentDepth + 1));\n    }\n    return acc;\n  }, []);\n};\n\nconst partsFlattened = parts.map((category) => {\n  const categoryFlattened = {\n    parts: flatten(category.parts),\n    title: category.title,\n    category: category.category,\n  };\n  return categoryFlattened;\n});\n```\n\nThis code fallens the given structure as the following.\n\n```javascript\n[\n  {\n    category: \"undefined\",\n    parts: [\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Color\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Palettes\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Contrast\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Meaning\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Swatches\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Typography\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Hierarchy\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Weights / types\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Web fonts\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Baseline grid\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Photography\",\n      },\n    ],\n    title: \"Visual language\",\n  },\n  {\n    category: true,\n    parts: [\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Paragraph\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Block quote\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Headers (H1 - H6)\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Lists\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Links\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Buttons\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Primary\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Secondary\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Button groups\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 1,\n        title: \"Menu buttons\",\n      },\n      {\n        depth: 0,\n        title: \"Slider\",\n      },\n    ],\n    title: \"UI elements\",\n  },\n];\n```\n\nLately, the flat structure can be used if, for instance, you need to output the items similarly but\nprovide additional CSS classes depending on the depth of the items.

The most common problem is incorrect URL resolving if a font is linked with `url()`. This post covers this and the following traps on your way to nice fonts on your webpage.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"small\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n<Image caption=\"Image source: https://processtypefoundry.com/blog/2011/02/five-new-webfonts/\">\n![](thumb.png)\n</Image>\n\n</div>\n\n## Load fonts\n\nInstruct your webpack how to load font with `file-loader`:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    test: /\\.(ttf|eot|woff|woff2|svg)$/,\n    use: {\n        loader: 'file-loader',\n        options: {\n            name: '[name].[ext]',\n            outputPath: 'fonts/'\n        },\n    },\n},\n```\n\nMore info about loading fonts options on [SurviveJs project](https://survivejs.com/webpack/loading/fonts/).\n\n## Resolve URLs\n\nIf you use SASS, you must face a problem of resolving URLs. Let's say your Webpack configuration for processing SASS files is like the following.\n\n```javascript\n{\n    test: /\\.scss$/,\n    loaders: [\n        'style-loader',\n        'css-loader',\n        'sass-loader',\n    ]\n},\n```\n\nEverything looks normal but you still get the following error for every single SASS file.\n\n```bash\nERROR in ./src/styles.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--5-1!./node_modules/resolve-url-loader!./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--5-3!./src/styles.scss)\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve './open-sans-v10-latin-regular.woff' in '/Users/varya/WebDev/my-pet-project'\n    @ ./src/styles.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--5-1!./node_modules/resolve-url-loader!./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--5-3!./src/styles.scss) 19:42-87\n```\n\nIn this case, you need to add `resolve-url-loader` because SASS itself does not do url rewriting.\n\n```javascript\n{\n    test: /\\.scss$/,\n    loaders: [\n        'style-loader',\n        'css-loader',\n        'resolve-url-loader', // add this before sass-loader\n        'sass-loader',\n    ]\n},\n```\n\nFor more information, you can check [Problems with url(...)](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/sass-loader/#problems-with-url) in Webpack official documentation.\n\n## SVG, I caught you!\n\nNote that the above configuration also applies to SVG files. You may have other SVG files that you do not want to process as fonts. In this case, do not forget to use `include` and `exclude` options.\n\nFor the fonts, include only the files from a directory where you keep fonts:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    test: /\\.(ttf|eot|woff|woff2|svg)$/,\n    use: {\n        loader: 'file-loader',\n        include: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/webfonts'),\n        options: {\n            name: '[name].[ext]',\n            outputPath: 'fonts/'\n        },\n    },\n},\n```\n\nFor SVG illustrations, exclude the font folder:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    test: /\\.svg$/,\n    exclude: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/webfonts'),\n    use: ['@svgr/webpack'],\n},\n```\n\n## Production: resolve URLs\n\nNow everything works in the development environment, but with production webpack configuration you must get the familiar error for every single SASS file.\n\n```bash\nERROR in ./src/styles.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--5-1!./node_modules/resolve-url-loader!./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--5-3!./src/styles.scss)\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve './open-sans-v10-latin-regular.woff' in '/Users/varya/WebDev/my-pet-project'\n    @ ./src/styles.scss (./node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--5-1!./node_modules/resolve-url-loader!./node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--5-3!./src/styles.scss) 19:42-87\n```\n\nFor production mode, you need to add `devtool: 'source-map'` to the root of your Webpack configuration. This is for the `resolve-url-loader` to work correctly also when building for production.\n\n## Turn off ES modules\n\nBy default, file-loader generates JS modules that use the ES modules syntax. But in the fonts case it would give you `src: url([object Module]);`. To avoid it, use `esModule: false,`\n\n```javascript\n{\n    test: /\\.(ttf|eot|woff|woff2|svg)$/,\n    use: {\n        loader: 'file-loader',\n        include: path.resolve(__dirname, './src/webfonts'),\n        options: {\n            name: '[name].[ext]',\n            outputPath: 'fonts/',\n            esModule: false,\n        },\n    },\n},\n```\n\n![](./enjoy.png)\n","excerpt":"Load fonts Instruct your webpack how to load font with :\n\nMore info about loading fonts options on SurviveJs project.\n\nResolve URLs\n\nIf you use SASS, you must face a problem of resolving URLs.

This applies to any kind of work, and managing design systems is no exception. Although it is a huge challenge, I very much like how things are going in our team. So that I collected here some tips which may help you as well.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"small\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n<Image caption=\"Image source: https://medium.com/@WebdesignerDepot/2-essential-rules-for-working-with-remote-clients-e7e289a6cb3d\">\n![](thumb.png)\n</Image>\n\n</div>\n\n## Keep in touch\n\nDesign systems connect people, and a design system team works as a conductor. Regular communication makes it all for us — meeting people in the office corridors, by cooler, at coffee we get new information from here and there. Often, that is a stronger source of demanded data than the official channels.\n\nWe can also use these situations to spread the word about the design system, be asked specific questions, and give instant answers.\n\nRemote work brings limited communication options, and we miss these spontaneous interactions and their advantages. Fixing this, it is worth to be prone to instant meetings. I am pushing myself to be more agreeable to such communication and prioritize it over other kinds of work. A little tip here: **reserve time for instant meetings**. The calendars often get fully booked, it was not such a problem in the office when the colleagues could catch you in between the meetings, but now it is. Reserving time in advance you can make sure that every day there is a moment when you are available for a quick chat.\n\nAt the same time, we have to be pro-active and not just wait when people come to us with their requests. On-time learning what other teams are working on makes a huge difference. Now they also work remotely and share a lot of information in text in their channels. Actively participating in all of them would be too much work but occasional reading is possible. So, **check how other teams are doing reading their channels** and contact specific people on specific topics if the need arises.\n\n## Spread information\n\nIn a large company, there can be dozens if not hundreds of people interested in updates about a design system. To respond to their interest, our team performed monthly presentations on the topic. Moving to all-remote, we faced the problem that not all the meeting systems can handle that many participants, even if everyone switches off the video and mutes their mic.\n\nHow then spread information? There are several options. You can simply share the slides of your presentation but make them more detailed. Or you can present alone in your room, **make a screencast of your presentation** and post the video in the company channels. If security policy allows, you can **use streaming services** like YouTube and present there.\n\n## Better meetings\n\nSmartly organized meetings are not design-system specific but still need to be. Here are some details I like.\n\n**Create shorter meetings** — 50 minutes instead of 1 hour, for example. People will thank you for an opportunity to drink some water, stretch their back, visit a bathroom.\n\n**Put meeting agenda** in the description field of the calendar event. A great tip for regular office life as well and extremely helpful now when we anyways get less information than previously.\n\nIf your calendar solution allows this, **give everyone invited permission to edit the meeting**. This way, they can update the agenda, extend, and re-schedule the meeting. I know, full control may sound scary for some of us but I also believe that we should trust our colleagues. Most likely they are reasonable people like ourselves and they will not do crazy things.\n\nWhenever possible, **share your screen**. In our team, we took this as a habit for our dailies, and they are now often even more informative then on-site ones.\n\n**Make meeting notes and share them** after the meeting. You can put the notes into a team channel or send an email to all the participants. Good documentation will stand you in good stead.\n\n## Socialize\n\nWhen working onsite, we interact not only as working units but also as people. This is the part many of us miss a lot nowadays. If there is enough time, I like to **start a meeting with a quick casual chat** as we normally did in our previous life. We often switch off the video because it ensures better sound quality but for the first few minutes I prefer to have it on and see my colleagues alive :-)\n\nOnce a week, we in the team have a **team lunch by video**. We start 12:15 (quarter past noon) so that everyone has time to prepare their food. We still often discuss work but anyways keep it much more casual then dailies and other work meetings.\n\n## Use the right tools\n\nIt's worth adopting new tools and features which introduce new ways of working helping to compensate for the inconvenience of isolation. There are plenty of suggestions now, and I share mine.\n\nMy own personal discovery was **comments in Figma**. We in the team are planning to use them more intensively to discuss designs. I like that it can keep our communication in cotext even though today it is more asynchronous than we are used to.\n\nFrom the developer perspective, we are also trying to make our work visible so that we could get feedback long before the release. Well-tuned automation helps a lot with it. For example, we have a **test URL with our Storybook** available within the company, and it **automatically updates once we push into `master`**. We use it for design reviews, and it turned out especially handy in the situation when we cannot just show our screens in real. Pushing the idea forward, we are thinking of the next step — separate test environment for every branch. This way, we could give a URL with real pixels even before we merge code.\n\nOne more discovery is the tools for collaborative online boards. Today they are must-have. It does not matter much which one you use, for example, advanced Figma users can even do everything there. But the market nowadays offers plenty of specific solutions — some are paid, some are free. We in the team are using [Mural](https://www.mural.co/), it allows anonymous contributors so we are sure that we can invite anyone from other teams with no additional cost. But I checked out many others, and this is the full list:\n\n- [Mural](https://www.mural.co/)<br/>\n  It offers a 30-day trial and has plenty of nice board templates.\n- [Miro](https://miro.com/)<br/>\n  A very popular tool recommended by many design teams.\n- [Jamboard](https://edu.google.com/products/jamboard/?modal_active=none)<br/>\n  This is a product by Google mostly oriented to students.\n- [BitPaper](https://www.bitpaper.io/)<br/>\n  Whiteboard and video chat solution.\n\n## Nice habits\n\nIn addition, I note random nice habits which make our remote life easier.\n\n**Keep your calendar up to date**, and **make it visible if you are busy or not**. If everyone does this, it gets much easier to schedule meetings. Many calendar solutions offer **scheduling assistant** which helps to find a slot when everyone is available. But it only works if the calendars reflect the availability.\n\nDo not forget to **book time for actual work**. Some people make whole days without meetings, some reserve a few hours every day. For the busy times, it might be a good idea to **reserve time for lunch**.\n\nIf your colleagues are using not only the in-company calendar but also other calendars (often happens for the consultants), **send invitations to all their emails** you know. Many people thanked me for doing this.\n\n**Document everything you are doing**, not only the gotten results but also the reasons behind the decisions were made.\n\n**Record important meetings** but do not forget to ask permission from every attendee.\n\n## More to read\n\nIf you want to read more about the best practices of remote work, here is a couple of links I liked:\n\n[Remote work for design teams](https://www.designbetter.co/remotework)<br/>\nWhole book by authors from Invision about remote work for design teams.\n\n[Working Remotely: Tips from 100+ Remote Workers & Leaders](https://www.helpscout.com/playlists/working-remotely/)<br/>\nGreat summary of tips and long lists of relevant articles.\n","excerpt":"Keep in touch Design systems connect people, and a design system team works as a conductor.

Our team once realised that we would benefit from custom issue types which we use for filtering and organising our Kanban board. However, \"realised\" is maybe not 100% suitable word since initially that was more kind of _hypothesis_ which we could prove or not. Simply speaking, we must try before we know.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"small\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n<Image caption=\"Image source: https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/business\">\n![](thumb.jpg)\n</Image>\n\n</div>\n\nJIRA is a very much customisable tool and introducing suitable issue types should not be any problem. However, the is always a \"but\". Often happens, especially in large organizations, that project managers do not have necessary admin rights to change such settings but they need to make a request to those who have, say IT support or even special JIRA administrators. In this case, it is better to be sure when asking for changes. This was exactly our case. So, we should have somehow prototype the settings we want, try them out and decide if we want to request them.\n\nThe case I am describing needed custom issue types, filters based on those types and a Kanban board with swimlanes filtered by the types. The prototyping meant that the filters and swimlanes would be done by some other properties but assuming that they are future-to-be issue types. Usually, project managers and often other team members have no restrictions to managing the project JIRA components and adding new ones. This was out case as well.\n\nSo, the way out would be to use components instead of issue types, try out the hypothesis and then decide. But as components were already in use for representing ... actual components, this could have made a mess. Unless there is a way to separate components from _components_. And this can be done in conventional mode by using prefixes.\n\nInitially, the components we had were as the following:\n\n- Header\n- Footer\n- Form elements\n\nWe kept them but renamed given them a prefix `§`:\n\n- § Header\n- § Footer\n- § Form elements\n\nFuture-to-be issue types were also implemented as issue components but with a different prefix:\n\n- \\# Research\n- \\# Development\n- \\# Education\n\nVoilà! Good enough for marking all the issues accordingly, making filters and board(s) and trying out for a sprint or two. As the components can be changed any time, their final list can also be formed while experiment goes. After a while, we had _certain request_ about the needed issue types for our JIRA administrators. And we were _fully certain_ that we are asking about something we were going to use for a long time.\n\nPS: Lately, we continued use such prefixes for grouping our components. But that's different story.\n","excerpt":"JIRA is a very much customisable tool and introducing suitable issue types should not be any problem.

Platforms innovate “by\nlinking activities in novel ways” and “by changing one or more parties that perform any of the activities” _(Amit and\nZott, 2012)_. These changes contribute to developing new business models, which results in the value creation. But the\nimportant attribute of the platforms is the mechanisms for creating this value.\n\nEven though the platforms form value proposition for the both (or more) sides, their key feature is that they do not\npurely create that value themselves. Instead, they provide the environment for these sides (or at least one of them) to\ncontribute and co-create the value. However, without platform existence this value does not appear either. Thus,\n“platforms fundamentally create value by acting as conduits between two (or more) categories of consumers who would not\nhave been able to connect or transact without the platform” _(Gawer, 2014)_.\n\nAlmost any Internet service can be given as an example to demonstrate the platforms. AirBNB operates on hospitality\ndomain linking guests and accommodation providers. Unlike other aggregators, it is targeted not to the hotels but to\nordinary people providing their homes for temporary renting. This way, AirBNB links two sides, which previously never\nacted on the same area, and propose a new value — an experience of “living like a local” for the guests and flexible and\neasy way or earning for the homeowners. This illustrates how “each side generally derives positive externalities from\nthe participation of members on the other side” _(Muzellec, Ronteau, and Lambkin, 2015)_. Even though AirBNB faced some\nlegal challenges in many cities, in general, they have changed the industry patterns and have developed a new market.\n\nAnother aspect of the platforms is that besides being innovative themselves, they also provide opportunities for further\ninnovations for their actors. This is mostly applicable to social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Having developed\nthe right environment for their end users, they do not guide them towards any direction. Instead, the options what\nexactly to do is completely up to the people whereas the platforms only provide opportunities and tools. As a result,\nthese platforms grew into whole eco-systems. Users’ activity on Facebook led to a major of groups (forums) and finally\nturned the social network into a knowledge bank. Driven by network effect, the Facebook content groups now provide more\ninformation than regular websites on a specific topic. In turn, this content attracts more and more users, who are very\ninteresting for the advertisers. Being a platform, Facebook did not actively participate in this value creation.\nMoreover, it did not even rule the groups where end users contribute. Platform’s openness made it for the users to\ncreate the environment and later operate in the very same environment. Thus, Facebook offers a platform for value\nco-creation and also the opportunity to co-create the platform itself. Such “domino” attribute in the value creation\naspect makes Facebook role even stronger. As we have already evidenced its affection onto the news market, the\ndisruptive effects to the others are yet coming.\n\nBoth AirBNB and Facebook are game-changers. As the platforms, they are complex modular systems mostly providing\nopportunities. In the platforms, the value creation is made by the parties involved whereas the role of the platform is\nto provide the environment and ensure the linking.\n\n### References\n\nAmit, R., & Zott, C.

As we cannot foresee the future, it is not possible to design a static business model\nonce and forever. Thus, to achieve and keep their business success, companies need ongoing innovative activity.\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"small\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n<Image caption=\"Image source: https://designbusinesscouncil.com/workshops/building-a-business-model/\">\n![](thumb.jpg)\n</Image>\n\n</div>\n\nTo apply the concept of business models to the innovation domain, first, we need to understand what they are. Business\nmodels can be seen from different perspectives. In their Critical Assignment, Massa, Tucci and Afuah outline 3 of such\nperspectives: “business models as attributes of real firms, business models as cognitive/linguistic schemas, and\nbusiness models as formal conceptual representations of how a business functions” _(Massa, Tucci and Afuah, 2016)_. And\nall the three interpretations can be used for innovation.\n\nBy their volume, the innovations can be divided into radical and incremental. Radical innovations are most likely\nexpensive and risky whereas incremental innovations are attributes of existing and most likely large businesses.\nApplying business model to the process of innovation helps with both.\n\nSpeaking about radical innovations, most likely in the situation of launching a new startup, the entrepreneurs can\nconsider business models as attributes of real firms and compare the models of different industries. Such comparison\n“may provide new insights and foster business model innovation” _(Osterwalder, 2005)_. While doing so, they will need a\nlanguage to share. This is an area where business model “linguistic schema” aspect helps. Linguistic schema works as a\ncommunication tool bringing people together, increasing the level of mutual understanding and contributing to their\nability to produce new values, which is exactly the final goal. Finally, a well-structured description of the upcoming\nbusiness, possibly having a graphical representation, opens new ideation opportunities and resonated with design\nthinking principles. By the design thinking, ideation should be “cycle of solving problems which starts from\nempathizing, is followed by ideation and making a prototype with the next testing and implementing”. _(Brown, 2008)_\nBusiness models as formal conceptual representation is a tool to be used in such innovative process.\n\n<div class=\"small\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n![](business-model-canvas.png)<br/>\nImage source:\n[http://blog.business-model-innovation.com/2015/06/product-is-not-the-value-proposition/](http://blog.business-model-innovation.com/2015/06/product-is-not-the-value-proposition/)\n\n</div>\n\nFor the incremental innovations, most likely desired in larger organizations, all the three representations play similar\nroles.\n\nGiven the size of an organization, any dramatic change becomes too risky and also impossible to perform assuming its\ncost. Business models as conceptual descriptions, however, provide a tool for simulation and testing the innovative\nideas. According to Osterwalder, “the business model concept can help foster innovation and increase readiness for the\nfuture through business model portfolios and simulation” _(Osterwalder, 2005)_. In other words, the innovative impact can\nbe split into iterations, which of those can be analyzed through the business model frameworks and tools before the\nactual implementation. Besides such approach decreases the level of uncertainty, it also allows lean methods. While\nworking on these innovative changes, the team would need to communicate and this requires a good communication tool,\nwhich is a business model as a linguistic schema. As in the other fields where people act in the environments with some\nlevel of uncertainty, shared language is a crucial part of success.\n\nBoth radical and incremental innovations can be seen in three different types depending on what exactly they change\n_(Amit and Zott, 2012)_:\n\n- “content”: innovation happened by adding new activities,\n- “structure”: innovation in linking activities in a new way,\n- “governance”: innovation happened by changing the roles of parties.\n\nNew activities refer to something different the company does. For example, Finnish “Posti” is actively innovating this\nway providing services barely associated with their main area, such as mowing lawns. Or Russian Yandex provided a taxi\naggregation service (similar to Uber), which by the time of its appearance was not at all coherent to the company main\narea (Internet search) but soon became profitable and formed an independent business department. These changes\nillustrate that “the main objective of business model innovation will thus be to tap into complementary assets of new\npartners to create a unique value proposition.” _(Bohnsack, Pinkse, and Kolk, 2014)_ In both examples, the end customers\nare now able to get new services.\n\nInnovation which provides changes into linking the activities contributes to the structure of an activity system. For\ninstance, Booking.com links the hotels and their customers in a way which is different to how they previously were linked\nvia travel operators. Similarly, Uber links drivers and riders. Or another Russian company SkyEng which links English\nlanguage tutors and people interested in improving their language skills. There is no open information about how SkyEng\ncame up with their business idea, but it is clearly made by analogy with the linking businesses of other domains. When\nanalyzing the core aspects of such companies, business models are needed to articulate the key parts and grasp the\nideas.\n\nInnovation which changes the roles of the parties redefines who performs the activity, in other words, changes the\ngovernance of the activity system. Various social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and many others, work as\na perfect example here. Similarly to the newspapers and magazines, they monetize through advertisements which they place\namong their main content. But one of the social networks’ innovation aspect was that this content is generated by\ndifferent actors. In the newspaper's case, they were the professional journalists required salary or fee whereas social\nnetworks get their content from the users for free and in enormous quantity. These are the examples of two-sided markets\nwhere the value is provided to both B2C and B2B sides. Business models can be applied to describing these platforms and\nso provide a simplified representation which is possible to study, explore in dynamics and iteratively change.\n\n## References\n\nChesbrough, H.
