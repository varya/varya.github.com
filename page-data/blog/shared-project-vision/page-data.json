An extra challenge is that such an understanding should be mutual.\nIt is especially hard to gain when working remotely. Since March 2020, most companies have sucessfully put the already set processes to the remote rails. However, it is not always\nthe case when it comes to creating something **new**. Despite the brainstorming sessions\nwith interactive boards, we still act more as individuals sitting in our living rooms and basements. This is something compeletely different from the situation when the whole team\nwas in the same room, when we had coffee breaks, lunches and afterworks, when we were in\nconstant communication and each team member at least partly understood the viewpoint of\nthe others. The new reality requires specific actions to substitude the natural process\nof getting each other. In this post, I share simple exercises we conducted with the team\nthat helped us on the way to shared project vision.\n\n</div>\n\n## Extended workshop and pair exersices\n\nIn fact, we had a traditional workshop with some taks and interactive whiteboards\nto complete them. But we made it extended in time, and this had a special meaning.\n\nOur team is 4 people, and we worked on 3 exercises in pairs. Such combination made it\npossible that every team member works with each and every of their fellows.\n\n<Image caption=\"Image source: https://www.africanbusinessreview.co.za/the-best-outdoor-team-building-activities.html\">\n![](./team.jpeg)\n</Image>\n\nThe pair combinations were as the following:\n\n- **Exercise 1**: Rose & Sean; Yves & Nicole\n- **Exercise 2**: Rose & Yves; Sean & Nicole\n- **Exercise 3**: Yves & Sean; Rose & Nicole\n\nThe task: _In all the exercises: think about the (sub)project you are committing as a member of a [design system] team. What are your goals for the rest of 2021 and in 2022? What are you doing? What do you want to achieve?_\n\nBy the plan, each team member should have done all the exercises. Each exersice had a specific goal but in general they were similar: one of the pair shares their vision and\nanswers the questions while another one facilitates and writes down the outcomes.\nWorking in pairs helped us to focus on each other more than in our group conversations.\n\nIt was possible to run all the exersices in one session using the breakout rooms but we\nhad them separately on different days, and for a reason. In all the exersices each of us needed to communicate our vision. We also needed to be very specific on that because it was our pair who wrote down the outcome. It happened, and I noticed that myself, that own\nunderstanding of the environment and the goals ahead crystalizes (sometimes even changes) when pronounced again and again. It was a good thing to sleep over with the ideas that had been just articulated, so that the next day they are more clear for its own author.\n\n## Exercise 1. The Context Onion\n\nBefore we came to the goals, it was useful to undestand our context.\n\n_Where are we as\nindividuals and our team on the organization map? Does our project belong to some\nbigger strutural unit or serve larger goal? What is its environment?_\n\nWhile the one was sharing their view, the other team member drew an onion diagram to reflect\nthe pronounced. In the outcome, we should see the whole context and also the highlighed\nactions on the different levels that affect the actor and the project.\n\n![](./context-onion.png)\n\n## Exercise 2. The impact we desire\n\nBeing mentally put into the right context, we managed to start thinking of what is the\nimpact we desire. That helps a bit to ground it down, so the next exersice was to\nfigure out the year goal(s) and the milestones on the way to it. While the one was\nspeaking on the topic, the facilitator guided them with the questions and drew a timeline with the goal that was a year ahead, and actions to complete in 6 months, 3 months and 1 month from now.\n\n![](./the-impact.png)\n\n## Exercise 3. Success criteria\n\nThe last exersice didn't require much drawing as the timeline could be borrowed from the previous one. However, since the workshop schedule assumed a different pair, it still required to explain the whole picture. After that, we needed to define the success criteria\nfor all the steps.\n\n_What exactly do you have to achieve in order to pronounce your \"project\" complete? What should be the success criteria on the go: in 6 months, in 3 months, in 1 month?_\n\nThis is also the moment when the context onion from the first exercise can help once again. _Is the success defined by you only or by the other layers too?_\n\n![](./success-criteria.png)\n\n## Common session. Summarise and reflect\n\nAfter all the exercises, we had a common session where we finally saw all the results together. After presenting them one by one, we combined all the timelines into one, identified logical connections between some actions, and adjusted the timeframes.\n\nIt depends on the project nature and scope, if you can take the outcome as your roadmap without dramatic changes. In the case of our project — no. But the **visualised shared vision** is a huge step towards such a roadmap. It is also great help when communicating with the other stakeholders on behalf of the whole team.\n\n![](./shared-vision.png)\n\nThe execises idea: [Facilitating change.
