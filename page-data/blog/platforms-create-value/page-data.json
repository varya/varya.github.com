Platforms innovate “by\nlinking activities in novel ways” and “by changing one or more parties that perform any of the activities” _(Amit and\nZott, 2012)_. These changes contribute to developing new business models, which results in the value creation. But the\nimportant attribute of the platforms is the mechanisms for creating this value.\n\nEven though the platforms form value proposition for the both (or more) sides, their key feature is that they do not\npurely create that value themselves. Instead, they provide the environment for these sides (or at least one of them) to\ncontribute and co-create the value. However, without platform existence this value does not appear either. Thus,\n“platforms fundamentally create value by acting as conduits between two (or more) categories of consumers who would not\nhave been able to connect or transact without the platform” _(Gawer, 2014)_.\n\nAlmost any Internet service can be given as an example to demonstrate the platforms. AirBNB operates on hospitality\ndomain linking guests and accommodation providers. Unlike other aggregators, it is targeted not to the hotels but to\nordinary people providing their homes for temporary renting. This way, AirBNB links two sides, which previously never\nacted on the same area, and propose a new value — an experience of “living like a local” for the guests and flexible and\neasy way or earning for the homeowners. This illustrates how “each side generally derives positive externalities from\nthe participation of members on the other side” _(Muzellec, Ronteau, and Lambkin, 2015)_. Even though AirBNB faced some\nlegal challenges in many cities, in general, they have changed the industry patterns and have developed a new market.\n\nAnother aspect of the platforms is that besides being innovative themselves, they also provide opportunities for further\ninnovations for their actors. This is mostly applicable to social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Having developed\nthe right environment for their end users, they do not guide them towards any direction. Instead, the options what\nexactly to do is completely up to the people whereas the platforms only provide opportunities and tools. As a result,\nthese platforms grew into whole eco-systems. Users’ activity on Facebook led to a major of groups (forums) and finally\nturned the social network into a knowledge bank. Driven by network effect, the Facebook content groups now provide more\ninformation than regular websites on a specific topic. In turn, this content attracts more and more users, who are very\ninteresting for the advertisers. Being a platform, Facebook did not actively participate in this value creation.\nMoreover, it did not even rule the groups where end users contribute. Platform’s openness made it for the users to\ncreate the environment and later operate in the very same environment. Thus, Facebook offers a platform for value\nco-creation and also the opportunity to co-create the platform itself. Such “domino” attribute in the value creation\naspect makes Facebook role even stronger. As we have already evidenced its affection onto the news market, the\ndisruptive effects to the others are yet coming.\n\nBoth AirBNB and Facebook are game-changers. As the platforms, they are complex modular systems mostly providing\nopportunities. In the platforms, the value creation is made by the parties involved whereas the role of the platform is\nto provide the environment and ensure the linking.\n\n### References\n\nAmit, R., & Zott, C.
