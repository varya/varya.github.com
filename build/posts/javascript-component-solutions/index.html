to face before the current open source era, when writing JavaScript for the
client side; showcase of possible solutions to these problems and explanations
of my choices.</p>
<excerpt/>

<h2 id="client-side-magic">Client-side magic</h2>
<p>I am going to write about client-side JavaScript code only which runs under a
browser and empowers an interface with interactivity.</p>
<p>A piece of interface is represented with some HTML (and obviously styled with
CSS). Also it can be equiped with JavaScript usually describing how to react to
user’s actions.</p>
<p>So, when developing a piece of interface, we write:</p>
<ol>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>Some code to link 2 to 1.<br/>
(This code says which part of HTML on a page corresponds to a JavaScript
component.)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-few-ways-to-matchmake">A few ways to matchmake</h2>
<p>Thus, the so-called ‘linking’ joins designated piece of JavaScript to its
corresponding piece of HTML. There are different ways around this.</p>
<h3 id="linking-with-event-attributes-the-old-school-way-">Linking with event attributes. The old school way.</h3>
<p>Since, in most cases running JavaScript is a reaction to some events firing,
there is an obvious way to declare in HTML what the reaction should be. These
are the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/scripts.html#events">intrinsic event
attributes</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if you need a hidden <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with an authorization form to be shown
when a user clicks on a ‘log in’ link you can write a JavaScript function for
that. Then, call it in with an <code>onclick</code> attribute.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;a href=&quot;/login-page&quot; onclick=&quot;return showLogin()&quot;&gt;log in&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;login-form&quot;&gt;
    &lt;form name=&quot;login&quot; ... &gt;
    ...
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">dom = document.getElementById ? true : false;

function showLogin() {
  if ( dom &amp;&amp; document.forms[&#39;login&#39;] ) {
    document.getElementById(&#39;login-form&#39;).style.display = &#39;block&#39;;
    return false;
  } else return true;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That works fine, except it uses global variables and demonstrates constraint
with choosing a script loading strategy, which will be detailed below. Also in
this case you cannot code any predefined action; everything happens after a user
does something.<br/>
I personally don’t like this method because it leaves JavaScript implants in
HTML code, whose main purpose is to describe the document structure, not page
behavior.</p>
<h3 id="moving-javascript-into-javascript">Moving JavaScript into JavaScript</h3>
<p>Therefore, a better way would be to stack everything related to JavaScript into
the page <code>.js</code> file.</p>
<p>From here I will write jQuery code to save time and space. If you prefer another
library, just get the gist.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.fn.myPlugin = function() {
  this.fadeIn(
    &#39;normal&#39;,
    function() { ... }
  );
}

...

$(&#39;#element&#39;).myPlugin();
</code></pre>
<p>With plugins you can describe behavioral pattern and then apply it to the
elements needed. In this case you don’t need to inject JavaScript into HTML any
more, which makes maintenance easier. But for every single element you still
have to write a line of code to apply the plugin.</p>
<h3 id="declaring-behavior-with-css-classes">Declaring behavior with CSS classes</h3>
<p>When having many controls per page it’s not useful to initialize each of them
separately. A better way would be to mark HTML block with a matching CSS class.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input class=&quot;js-myPlugin&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;login&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.fn.myPlugin = function() {
  this.fadeIn(
    &#39;normal&#39;,
    function() { ... }
  );
}

$(&#39;.js-myPlugin&#39;).myPlugin();
</code></pre>
<p>With that you need your ‘linking’ code only once for a plugin; it can be written
in the plugin file to maintain consistency.</p>
<h3 id="one-css-class-to-rule-them-all">One CSS class to rule them all</h3>
<p>However, when the variety of components grows, the ‘linking’ solution should be
even more declarative. If there is JavaScript to run for a component, it will be
visible from the block HTML structure. You can mark all the ‘alive’ parts of
your page with a special CSS class; for now let’s stick with <code>js</code> class.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input
  class=&quot;inpt js&quot;
  data-component=&quot;myPlugin&quot;
  name=&quot;login&quot;
  value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The step up of this method is the need of information which plugin is to apply
to a particular control and a little more code to initialize. This leads onto a
question about how to parametrize the component. This example suggests data
attributes although there is another idea (spoiler!).</p>
<p>With minor change there is the code initializing a proper JavaScript component
for all the blocks on a page:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$(&#39;.js&#39;).each(function() {
    var $this = $(this);
    $this[$this.data(&#39;component&#39;)]();
})
</code></pre>
<h2 id="parametrizing">Parametrizing</h2>
<p>Not only a component name has to be provided when initializing with <code>js</code> CSS
class. Different instances of the same component also may need to pass some
information. For example, an input plugin can validate the field value. But
depending on the input different kinds of data can be expected.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.fn.myInput = function() {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input name=&quot;login&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;input name=&quot;zipcode&quot; value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It is easy to provide per-instance parameters when initializing every instance
separately.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$(&#39;input[name=&quot;login&quot;]&#39;).myInput({
  validator: &#39;login&#39;
});
$(&#39;input[name=&quot;zipcode&quot;]&#39;).myInput({
  validator: &#39;zipcode&#39;
});
</code></pre>
<h3 id="data-attributes">data attributes</h3>
<p>With more declarative manner you need to include such information into a
component HTML structure. Already mentioned data attributes can help with that.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input
  class=&quot;inpt js&quot;
  data-component=&quot;myInput&quot;
  data-validator=&quot;login&quot;
  name=&quot;login&quot;
  value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;

&lt;input
  class=&quot;inpt js&quot;
  data-component=&quot;myInput&quot;
  data-validator=&quot;zipcode&quot;
  name=&quot;login&quot;
  value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.fn.myInput = function() {
    if (this.data(&#39;validator&#39;) === &#39;login&#39;) // Supported by many frameworks
}
</code></pre>
<p>Data attributes is a brainchild of HTML5, so carry a doctype when using them.</p>
<p>As a widespread solution with many libraries providing helpers for them, data
attributes make parametrizing not difficult. Although the limitation of being
able to use key-value pairs only can affect the plugin architecture.</p>
<h3 id="onclick">onclick</h3>
<p>An elegant way is to provide data for a JavaScript component using natural
JavaScript format, such as hashes. Here the event attributes can serve us again.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input
    class=&quot;myInput&quot;
    onclick=&quot;return {
        validator: &#39;login&#39;
    }&quot;
    name=&quot;login&quot;
    value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>When a user normally clicks, the hash is booleanized into <code>true</code>, so the default
browser click reaction is exactly as expected. From your plugin you can call the
event-named method and get the data in its native JavaScript format without any
need to parse and convert.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.fn.myInput = function() {
 this[0].onclick().validator === &#39;login&#39;
};
</code></pre>
<p>As JavaScript, this data can be of any type. Not only strings and numbers, but
large treeish hashes, arrays and even functions are possible. Such flexibility
is extra salutary for organizing data when writing complex components and for
customization.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input
    class=&quot;inpt js&quot;
    onclick=&quot;return {
        component: &#39;myInput&#39;,
        validator: function() { ... }
    }&quot;
    name=&quot;login&quot;
    value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>With nested hashes an HTML block can be operated by 2 or more different
JavaScript components, each with its own set of parameters.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input
    class=&quot;inpt js&quot;
    onclick=&quot;return {
        &#39;myInput&#39; : {
            validator: function() { ... }
        },
        &#39;anotherPlugin&#39; : {}
    }&quot;
    name=&quot;login&quot;
    value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="start-fast">Start fast</h2>
<h3 id="initializing-components">Initializing components</h3>
<p>Applying plugins to elements is only possible when the page is loaded and your
library can look for these elements in the document.</p>
<p>First, you can link the script file after its related piece of HTML code.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input
    class=&quot;myInput&quot;
    onclick=&quot;return {
        validator: &#39;login&#39;
    }&quot;
    name=&quot;login&quot;
    value=&quot;&quot;/&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;js/plugins/myInput.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Whilst it can work sometimes, the method is just unreliable. It’s not certain
that the DOM will be ready by the time of the script loaded. Loading every
plugin as a separate file definitely slows down the page. In addition, this is
just ugly.</p>
<p>The page needs to be loaded when running scripts. So, logically an <code>onload</code> event
on the <code>window</code> object can help.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$(window).load(function(){
    $(&#39;.js&#39;).each(function() {
        var $this = $(this);
        $this[$this.data(&#39;component&#39;)]();
    })
})
</code></pre>
<p>The drawback is that <code>window.onload</code> occurs when all the content is loaded.
Including images, which mostly are not necessary to run scripts.</p>
<p>The time to safely initialize your components is right after the document has
been loaded and parsed into DOM, which is accompanied by a <code>document.ready</code> event.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$(function() {
    $(&#39;.js&#39;).each(function() {
        var $this = $(this);
        $this[$this.data(&#39;component&#39;)]();
    })
})
</code></pre>
<p>With that all the plugins used can be bundled into one JavaScript file and
linked to a page within the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element as usual. Purposely loaded in
advance, the script will be run when the page is ready.</p>
<h3 id="loading-scripts">Loading scripts</h3>
<p>Although, putting <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag into <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> also delays page loading. A better
strategy is to draw a page as fast as possible and then introduce JavaScript
magic. Reach that by placing <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when a user sees a page, it is expected to work. By now, it’s
hardly possible to respond user actions with plain HTML; people are used to rich
interfaces. If that’s crucial for your page functioning, divide the script file
into 2. The first one linked in <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> provides major functionality. And the
second, placed before <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> contains all the magic tricks.</p>
<h2 id="common-best-practises">Common best practises</h2>
<h3 id="cover-up">Cover up</h3>
<p>In this article, I switched from calling <code>showLogin</code> function to jQuery plugins
and some improvements were made in linking components to HTML code. But more
than this, giving JavaScript responsibility for the page behavior also enables
to step forward with avoiding global variables in the code.</p>
<p>This is true not only for JavaScript. The ids, form names and input names (all
the things that can be named in HTML) are also a kind of global object.</p>
<p>Common advice is to avoid their use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By reducing your global footprint to a single name, you significantly reduce
the chance of bad interactions with other applications, widgets, or libraries.
Douglas Crockford</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the <a href="http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html">module
pattern</a>
wrapping your component into self-invoking anonymous function all the global
variables turn into local ones.</p>
<p>Use CSS classes instead of <code>id</code> and <code>name</code> attributes to identify elements and
access them from JavaScript. This makes code more declarative, introduces
flexibility and is easier to maintain in the long run.</p>
<h3 id="doublecheck-you-don-t-double-do">Doublecheck you don’t double-do</h3>
<p>Initializing components can take time and resources. So, when first initialized,
the result can be saved and reused later. jQuery provides a nice <code>data</code> method
suitable for that.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.fn.myPlugin = function() { return this.each(function() {
  var $this = $(this),
      data = $this.data(&#39;myPlugin&#39;);
  if (!data) {
    // init...
    $this.data(&#39;myPlugin&#39;, { /* ... */ });
  }
}};
</code></pre>
<h3 id="life-beyond-the-element">Life beyond the element</h3>
<p>If the corresponding block has been removed from a page, it’s the component’s
responsibility to clean up. Event listeners, constant background calculations
and even layout changes, that could have happend before. When being deactivated,
a component has to place things back with a <code>destroy</code> method.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.fn.myPlugin = function() { return this.each(function() {
  var $this = $(this),
      data = $this.data(&#39;myPlugin&#39;);
  if (!data) {
    // init...
    $this.data(&#39;myPlugin&#39;, {
      destroy: function() { /* ... */ }
    });
  }
}};
</code></pre>
<h3 id="initializing-by-request">Initializing by request</h3>
<p>With dynamically changed pages it’s not enough to initialize components just the
ones after <code>domReady</code>. There has to be some code to run every time you append
new block onto a page, which turns HTML fragment into a functioning component.</p>
<pre><code>$.fn.myInit = function() {
    this.find(&#39;.js&#39;).each(function() {
        var $this = $(this);
        $this[$this.data(&#39;component&#39;)]();
    });
    return this;
})
</code></pre><p>A special method to destroy the components being removed has similar sense.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.fn.myDestroy = function() {
    this.find(&#39;.js&#39;).each(function() {
        var $this = $(this),
            name = $this.data(&#39;component&#39;);
        $this.data(name).destroy();
    });
    return this.remove();
})
</code></pre>
<h3 id="lazy-initialization">Lazy initialization</h3>
<p>One more trick is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization">lazy
initialization</a> of components.
The idea is similar to <a href="https://github.com/stevekwan/best-practices/blob/master/javascript/best-practices.md#lazy-load-assets-that-arent-immediately-required">lazy
loading</a>
and merely means do as less as possible beforehand.</p>
<p>Instead of initializing all the components when <code>domReady</code> fires, you can do
this separately for every component at the time the particular component needs
that. Usually that’s after a user started to interact with
it and the respective events triggered. So, all the necessary predefined actions
won’t be run in advance and won’t
slow down page rendering and the work of other components. Objects corresponding
to never-used components won’t be created, which saves memory.</p>
<h2 id="component-core">Component core</h2>
<p>Many code practises above would be repeated again and again when implementing
a lot of components. As you can guess, all the common things can be wrapped with
a framework representing the core code for the components.</p>
<p>One of the examples of this is jQuery UI. As many other frameworks it provides
API to create your own JavaScript components.</p>
<h3 id="predefined-component-structure">Predefined component structure</h3>
<p>With a component framework a developer uses API and describes a predefined
component structure. All the common things are in the core.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.widget(&#39;my.component&#39;, {
    _create: function() { /* ... */ },
    destroy: function() { /* ... */ }
    myMethod: function() { /* ... */ },
});
</code></pre>
<h3 id="high-level-patterns">High-level patterns</h3>
<p>Besides predefined structure, frameworks also provide architectural solutions to
different problems.<br/>
For example, with the releaving modules a core can provide an API to extend the
main component functionality.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">$.widget(&#39;ui.dialog&#39;, $.ui.dialog, {
    close: function() {
        if(confirm(&#39;Close???&#39;)) {
            this._super(&#39;close&#39;)
        }
    }
})
</code></pre>
<p>Component frameworks define basics for reusing code and implementing reusable
JavaScript modules.</p>
<p>Another example of such a high-level component framework is JavaScript part of
<a href="http://bem.info/">BEM</a>. A developer can operate components with OOP common
patterns; create classes, their dynamic and static methods, as well as inherit
component and extend their functionality and reuse basics with super calls.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">BEM.DOM.decl(
    { block: &#39;my-dialog&#39;, baseBlock: &#39;dialog&#39; },
    {
        myMethod: function() {
            this.__base();
            this.__self.myStaticMethod();
        }
    },
    {
    myStaticMethod: function() { /*...*/ }
    }
);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="from-now-on">From now on</h2>
<p>A number of JavaScript frameworks and libraries were created last years.
Generally they contain the solutions to the problems listed and also cover
others, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>loading by request</li>
<li>building page <code>.js</code> files</li>
<li>dependency system</li>
<li>complex component relations and data sharing</li>
<li>data binding</li>
</ul>
<p>With comparing articles like <a href="http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2012/08/01/rich-javascript-applications-the-seven-frameworks-throne-of-js-2012/">Rich JavaScript Applications – the Seven
Frameworks</a>
by Steven Sanderson you can choose the one you like and have a quick look under
the hood.</p>
