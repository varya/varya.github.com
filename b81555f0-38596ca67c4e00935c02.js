In phase 2, the researcher organised the selected themes into a system based on relationships between them. Since the grouping work was conducted with a virtual whiteboard and sticky notes, the representation of the relationships was also formed there naturally providing its visual version. The result of phase 2 was a schematic description of both positive and negative design system impact elements.

During phase 3, the researcher was looking for an application of the emerged impact elements to the existing theoretical knowledge.

This research results in the representation of the new process of UI creation that was transformed from the old-school process due to application of design systems. In a nutshell, design systems ease the multidisciplinary communication but require the team members to be careful not to complicate their process too much. The overall quality of the project increases if the design system policy is flexible. A design system requires time and resource investments but in the long run, it improves the productivity of the team (on both design and development sides). The ready-made components offered by a design system speed up the product creation process as well as generating new design ideas and meeting the customer and business needs. The research provides a detailed description of the (mostly positive) impact that such a new process and its sub-processes make. The research analyses the process transformation and its drivers from the CMMI perspective and sets that introducing a design system into the UI creation signals of managing characteristics that belong to the high-maturity levels 4 and 5."),"\n",i.createElement(t.h2,{id:"references",style:{position:"relative"}},i.createElement(t.a,{href:"#references","aria-label":"references permalink",className:"anchor before"},i.createElement(t.span,{dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:'<svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg>'}})),"References"),"\n",i.createElement(t.p,null,"ATLAS.ti (2019).
