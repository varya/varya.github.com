As you might know, I recently run the [BEM
LOVE](https://github.com/toivonen/bem-love) project to demonstrate how blocks
can communicate with JavaScript.<excerpt/>

The first example is dull enough; [a boy, a girl and the heartless
world](http://toivonen.github.com/bem-love/desktop.bundles/ask-her-what-music-she-likes/ask-her-what-music-she-likes.html).

Today, I was going to start with another one with a boy plunging into
difficulties of choice. He has [two girls to
ask](http://toivonen.github.com/bem-love/desktop.bundles/choose-the-one/choose-the-one.html).
Suddenly there is a **challenge for you**.

Let's think if it's possible to attract a boy with a booooooring one-colour
dress? Seems like no.<br/>
So, the girls in the page are in need of nice patterned dresses. Any ideas on
how to code a patterned triangle in CSS?

### Where to code?
To dress the girls excellenty and toppingly you need just three steps:

 * Fork the project and [run the
server](https://github.com/toivonen/bem-love#how-to-contribute).
 * [Contribute to modifiers](https://github.com/toivonen/bem-love/tree/master/desktop.bundles/choose-the-one/blocks/girl/_dressed)
 * Make your pull request
